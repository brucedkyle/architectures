    <h1 id="product-lifecycle-management">Product lifecycle management</h1>
<p>Waste and water management are among the high priority items that are part of environmental sustainability goals. </p>
<p>Visibility of an organization's assets and associated material components and gain insights into its global waste profile, the company can better engage the waste management team, supply chain team, equipment manufacturers and waste haulers. </p>
<p>By using this cradle-to-grave method allows the company to integrate with environmental reporting processes and incentivize sustainability improvement across the organization.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>Organizations want to enhance the tracking of assets and associated material components across the enterprise. Through improved visibility into job activities and an asset's lifecycle, the organization can better understand and drive change using data-driven insights. </p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>As outlined in a Pennsylvania State University study, "<em>Hazardous Waste</em> is any Waste that has been designated, characterized or otherwise regulated as hazardous by applicable laws or regulations in a country, state, region, or locality. Examples can include a corrosive liquid or a flammable solvent.</p>
<p>"<em>Product End of Life Management (PELM)</em> refers to the demanufacturing, dismantling, reuse, reclamation, recycling, shredding, treatment and / or disposal of end-of-life (EOL) IT equipment and parts."</p>
<h2 id="business-problem">Business problem</h2>
<p>The business problem consists of two major parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>First is the management (collection, transportation, recycling treatment or disposal) of hazardous and nonhazardous special waste that comes from internal operations (e.g., facility operations, on-site waste water treatment, research, manufacturing processes, and environmental remediation programs). Such byproducts are reduced and recycle when possible, followed by treatment and disposal (incinerated and/or sent to landfills).</li>
<li>Second are products or their parts and components that have reached their intended end of life (a.k.a PELM). These materials may be generated from your own operations or by your clients. These PELM materials may still have value and can be refurbished and resold or, may be disassembled and their parts harvested for reuse or scrapped. </li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the scrapping process may involve recoverable materials (e.g., ferrous and non-ferrous metals, precious metals, glass, plastics, etc.) that have intrinsic value and are sold in secondary commodity markets, or waste materials (e.g., non-recyclable packaging material, non-recyclable plastics, shredder fluff, etc.) that have no value and require proper treatment or disposal. </p>
<p>Waste materials may be considered hazardous or nonhazardous depending on government designation.</p>
<p>Often the disposal of hazardous wastes are contracted through third parties.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business Drivers</h3>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Waste management team manually gathers disposal data from individual haulers for each facility in the organization.</li>
<li>Manual data collection method limits internal data validation to sporadic certification spot-checks.</li>
<li>No real-time visibility into hazardous waste lifecycles or raw materials to actively engage with vendors and ensure hazardous waste compliance and forecasting</li>
<li>Field teams manage the end-to-end lifecycle and disposal process in spreadsheets</li>
<li>The recycling process is manually managed by external regional haulers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting strict compliance with regional hazardous waste management standards</li>
<li>Setting and meeting environmental waste targets</li>
<li>Streamline replacement work order management and asset tracking process</li>
<li>Tracability and controls of waste disposal</li>
<li>Advise on automation replacement work-orders to engage with waster haulers for reconcilation</li>
<li>Streamline collection, tracking and reporting of hazardout materials</li>
<li>Monitor and forecast waste targets</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="business-outcomes">Business outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved management of regulatory compliance and third-party audit certification.</li>
<li>Enhanced monitoring by tracking against zero waste targets and diversion rate per location.</li>
<li>Enhanced visibility of entire lifecycle from consumption to responsible disposal and recycling.</li>
<li>Improved visibility, monitoring and management of assets and consumables including hazardous and non-hazardous waste.</li>
<li>Gaining both global view and site level view of consolidated environmental sensitive cradle-to-grave equipment and parts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>The solution shown in Figure 1 uses components that can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. </li>
<li>Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red Hat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.</li>
<li>Sustainable enterprise systems acts to coordinate facilities management with workplace management backed by sustainability reporting.</li>
</ul>

<p>From a high-level perspective, the <strong>Action Guide</strong> represents a future state for organizations considering a comprehensive commitment. The idea is to outline a set steps that can be prioritized to reach that future state by adding new functionality to your existing systems.</p>

<li>Automation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Modernization</li>
