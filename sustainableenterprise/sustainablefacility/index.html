    <h1 id="sustainable-facility">Sustainable facility</h1>
<p>Companies are setting environmental commitments for facilities, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achieving net zero green house gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 </li>
<li>Diverting 90% of nonhazardous waste (by weight) from landfill and incineration by 2025</li>
</ul>
<p>Real estate plays a critical role in meeting these targets. Buildings account for <a href="https://architecture2030.org/">40% of the annual carbon dioxide emissions</a> globally.</p>
<p>More than 80% of CEOs expect sustainability investments to produce improved business results in the next five years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key to a successful sustainability strategy is balancing the environmental drivers with market demands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Real estate is typically one of the largest expenses for an organization. Now an organization can make the most out of every square inch and meter of space.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/why-the-buildings-of-the-future-are-key-to-an-efficient-energy-ecosystem/">World Economic Forum</a> explains, energy consumption in the built environment accounted for 40% of global energy use and 33% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2019. In Europe alone, more than 220 million existing buildings – or 75% of the building stock – are energy-inefficient, with many relying on fossil fuels for heating and cooling. </p>
<p>They continue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more innovative, more efficient and cheaper way is to equip buildings with the digital tools that allow them to automatically adjust heating, lighting and other systems to the number of people present at any given time, using real-time data analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Executing on this mission involves a staggering number of decisions, ranging from room configurations and leasing terms, to capital project planning and facilities maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>Manage competing needs with constrained resources. </p>
<p>Improve an organization’s capital project management capabilities.</p>
<p>Manage buildings to encourage sustainability through the real estate lifecycle. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include sustainability criteria in space acquisition and disposals (ISO 14000 as an example)</li>
<li>Prioritize sustainability in construction and renovation projects</li>
<li>Enable energy efficiency with green leases</li>
<li>Reduce waste by integrating portfolio data</li>
<li>Reach carbon footprint goals with space optimization</li>
<li>Extend asset life through improved maintenance and assessment</li>
<li>Maintain compliance to regulations and manage remediation with integrated Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS/HSE) processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimize the environmental impact of your operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut energy use.</li>
<li>Minimize/combine facility management work orders.</li>
<li>Use data from sensors, such as HVAC, refrigerator and freezer temperatures.</li>
<li>Identify and manage energy usage.</li>
<li>Green IT, reducing environmental impact of your data center.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Roughly 40% of the global share of annual carbon dioxide emissions comes from buildings. The UN Environment Program states that if nothing is done, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from buildings will more than double in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>To meet targets for green house gas (GHG) emissions, buildings and cities must shift from being part of the problem to being part of the solution. </p>
<h2 id="business-problem">Business problem</h2>
<p>There is a constant tension between using every square inch of space, reducing real estate operating costs, and creating outstanding occupant experiences.</p>
<p>IDC in its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-49090">Worldwide Integrated Workplace Management System 2020–2021 Vendor Assessment</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now organizations must prioritize creating safe and productive environments for their employees, students, and customers. In the short term, organizations had to take measures such as allowing a dramatic shift to working remotely where possible, modifying floor plans for social distancing, reducing building capacity, implementing new schedules, and deploying novel technology. Real estate and facility professionals have turned to a variety of "return-to-work solutions" for space reservations, health attestation, contact tracing, proximity monitoring, wayfinding, cleaning, communications, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Organizations have an unprecedented opportunity to capture and analyze their data and develop greater operational resiliency and effectiveness. These data insights give companies the tools needed to react quickly to change, care for their employees and occupants, and make strategic space and occupancy decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sustainability promotes business, supports the needs of our customers, generates profitability, and 
contributes to a better world. This is how we see our transformative role.<br/>
&mdash; Fausto Ribeiro, CEO of Banco do Brasi</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business Drivers</h3>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are several challenges to overcome in the pursuit of becoming a truly sustainable business:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer readiness</strong>. While the mindset around sustainability is shifting, no business can afford to be left behind, and few can financially afford to be too far ahead of the appetite for sustainable offerings. Co-creating a sustainable future requires a deep understanding of your customers and having partners with the right relationships and ecosystems to bring them along on the journey.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>. Implementing sustainable business practices typically requires higher upfront investments. In the short term, it will often be cheaper to stick with the status quo. Some organizations will need help building an investment case to show how immediate investment will result in more durable profitability over the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Systemic inertia</strong>. While sustainability is an important goal, it often isn’t seen as more important than other key priorities that may provide benefits sooner. Many businesses plan in ten-year increments, so while a 2050 commitment is good, it often isn’t enough to drive sufficient action in this decade, from a planning standpoint. It comes back to reframing risks as opportunities and building the case that acting on sustainability now is necessary to achieving future sustainability in business.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of tools, insights and expertise</strong>. Being unprepared to develop a corporate sustainability vision, strategy and framework is a monumental risk. Companies may lack the ability to implement sustainable solutions or even know where to start. Sustainability in business is evolving and so are the answers. Every business needs an ecosystem of innovation partners to help them reinvent the world and create a sustainable future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capture and calculate carbon emissions data</strong>, report it according to regulations and set targets to drive action.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce energy costs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Include ESG criteria in decision making</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize environmental improvement projects</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Improve an capital project management capabilities</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Use AI models to “squeeze” more insights from the existing sensors</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sustainable facilties workflow steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect sensor and energy consumption (energy, refrigerators, HVAC) across the enterprise. Unusual data can be from a piece of equipment that no longer functions, a walk-in refrigerator door being left open, HVAC that is providing temps outside of nominal ranges
<li>Sensors report to Intelligent Assets and Facilities Management software that provides alerts. AI is used to determine abnormal behavior of data from sensors.
<li>Data is sent in real time to Intelligent Assets and Facilities system to take remediation actions, provide information for space planning and utilization
<li>Data is sent in real time to the Sustainability Control Tower, an enterprise-wide repository.
<li>A Data Fabric provides consistent ways of pulling data from existing data, maps data heirarchies between systems, removing inconsistencies in data.
<ol type="a">
<li>Intelligence Assets and Facilities software collects data. (It also provides work orders, proactive maintence, project planning.) 
</ol>
<li>Data is collected in Sustainability Control Tower and used for decision making across the enterprise, across multiple scenarios.
<li>Sustainability Manager, Facility Managers, company execs reviews KPI, update energy consumption metrics, sets energy consumption goals. Uses the insights it generates to help informed decision-making that makes both business and environmental sense
<li>Sustainability Control Tower provides reporting for compliance and to demonstrate the impacts of decisions on sustainability and the environment.
