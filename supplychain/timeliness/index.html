    <h1 id="product-timeliness">Product timeliness</h1>
<p>Foods and ingredients expire or become unusable at some point. Manufactured parts and goods also experience decay and deterioration. Each of these may be measured.</p>
<p>In the food industry, you may see different terms and date types on the packaging, the following are common practices and their meanings according to the USDA and FDA as explained in <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/expiring-products-food-ingredients">Expiring Products – Food &amp; Ingredients</a> by Michigan State University:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best if used by/before: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it’s the date where the food may be at its best quality </li>
<li>Use by: on any food OTHER than infant formula, this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it’s the date where the food may be at its best quality. If “used by” is present on infant formula, it’s an expiration date, and you should discard the infant formula after the use by date.  </li>
<li>Sell by: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it’s the date where the food may be at its best quality </li>
<li>Freeze by: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it’s the date where the food should be frozen to maintain the best quality </li>
<li>Expiration or EXP: this is an expiration date and usually only found on infant formula and some baby foods </li>
<li>Guaranteed fresh: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it’s the date where the food may be at its best quality </li>
</ul>
<p>Other products, particularly pharmaceuticals, must be used within specific time frames to be warantted or to be considered safe and effective. </p>
<p>Manufactured parts may be warranteed for specific periods or number of uses. For example, manufactured parts must be replaced when outside of certain tolerances.</p>
<p>Some products may still continue to be useful beyond their expiration date or use. </p>
<p>For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see <a href="../supplychain/">Inventory Optimization</a>.</p>
<h2 id="business-problem">Business problem</h2>
<p>Product liability claims can wreck a business. </p>
<p>Defects and liability risks affect product manufacturers, designers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. Physical or digital items that omit adequate warnings, injure a third party, or cause a wrongful death can lead to lawsuits for any party involved in the product.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<p>How should a business track and respond to issues?</p>
<ul>
<li>Responding to <em>Shelf life</em> defines a set of actions to be taken with products that expire on specific dates and must be removed from use or sale. For example, food can expire and need to be removed from shelves. </li>
<li><em>Relevance</em> defines a set of actions that can be taken when products are no longer relevance, possibly due to seasonality, but that may be still have some benefit. For example, seasonality of clothing can be warehoused until the following year.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both shelf life and timeliness, you will want to plan and to take proactive steps in anticipation of product expirations.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business Drivers</h2>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Protect public safety by automating tracking and remediating items for shelf life and relevance</li>
<li>Mitigate risks through specific actions, such as product removal, replacement, work order tracking to demonstrate the product is handled with due care</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve Public safety through automated shelf life tracking and management</li>
<li>Reduce product liability claims through automation and AI</li>
<li>Demonstrate due diligence for safety </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="responses">Responses</h3>
<p>Many goods offered in retail and supplier businesses expire. </p>

<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>This solution focuses on <em>Automation</em> and <em>Modernization</em> in our Action Guide as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation. </li>
<li>Accelerate automation in extended workflows</li>
<li>Amp up AI to make workflows smarter</li>
<li>Modernize for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="solution overview" src="../media/timelinesssolution.png" /></p>
<p>The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. </li>
<li>Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on RedHat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop. </li>
<li>Inventory Optimization platform</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solution-principles">Solution Principles</h2>
<p><strong>True end-to-end visibility</strong>. Remove data silos and create a unified view across supply chain data with a standard data platform. Personalized dashboards and insights provide a 360-degreee view of KPIs and significant events.</p>
<p><strong>Manage by exception</strong>. Detect, display, and prioritize work tasks in real time. This allows clients to sense and react to issues quickly while managing risks and disruptions in a supply chain proactively.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligent workflows</strong>. Actionable workflows can be customized to meet unique requirements and process steps required to automate actions within source transactional systems. Make informed decisions with a supply chain virtual assistant that provides responses to issues based on a client’s supply chain data using natural language search.</p>
<h2 id="timelinessshelf-life">Timeliness/Shelf life</h2>
<p>The following diagram shows the schematic for the Timeliness/Shelf life use case.</p>
<p><img alt="shelf life schematic" src="../media/shelflifechematic.svg" /></p>
<p>Timeliness/Shelf life steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inventory Control Tower hueristics determines product inventory is near its "Use by" date</li>
<li>Inspects current inventory</li>
<li>Notifies the Inventory Controller to take action</li>
<li>Creates replenishment order</li>
<li>Engages partners (Charity, recycler) to remediate expired or near expired stock</li>
</ol>
