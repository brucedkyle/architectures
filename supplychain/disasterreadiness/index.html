    <h1 id="disaster-readiness">Disaster readiness</h1>
<p>Companies are facing natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, including those impacted by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate change, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts</li>
<li>Acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; energy shortages</li>
<li>Public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines </li>
</ul>
<p>Each can negatively affect your supply chain operations and financial performance. </p>
<p>In this article, we discuss how your organization can prepare for business disruption, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparations when a weather event is anticipated.</li>
<li>How systems can work together to mitigate the business disruption when stores become disconnected from corporate data centers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-case">Use case</h2>
<p>Events could result in physical damage to our properties, limitations on store operating hours, less frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses.</p>
<p>In 2020, there were <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2020-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters-historical">22 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters</a> in the US alone and you can understand why modeling the risk from weather is so critical to your operations. </p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Business need to anticipate and respond to supply chain challenges due to unanticipated disasters.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.thebci.org/">Business Continuity Institute</a>, 72% of suppliers who dealt with a breakdown in their supply chain lacked the full, real-time visibility needed to come up with a fast and simple solution.</p>
<h2 id="business-problem">Business problem</h2>
<p>A central feature is time to recover (TTR), the time it would take for a particular node — a supplier facility, a distribution center, or a transportation hub — to be restored to full functionality after a disruption.</p>
<p>The second concept is risk exposure, an assessment of exposure to risk based on a model that applies suppliers' TTR to estimate the performance impact, including operational (lost production) and financial (lost revenue and profit).</p>
<h3 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business Drivers</h3>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Harvard Business Review article identified the following objectives for companies facing disaster situtations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify exposure to risk associated with parts and suppliers.</li>
<li>Prioritize and allocate resources effectively.</li>
<li>Invest in mitigation strategies such as booking logistics capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitor for disruptive environmental conditions</strong> such as severe weather, wildfires, flooding, air quality, and carbon emissions and receive alerts when detected.</li>
<li><strong>Predict potential impacts</strong> of climate change and weather across the business using climate risk analytics.</li>
<li><strong>Reconfigure supply chain</strong> Some critical but vulnerable suppliers will go out of business.</li>
<li><strong>Reposition inventory</strong> in anticipation of certain regions or facilities facing disaster.</li>
<li><strong>Route deliveries around impacted areas</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous operation when store are disconnected from corporate data center</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>The solution shown in Figure 1 uses components that can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core application systems</strong>. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management or facilities management. These systems can be standalone applications, on-premises and cloud services, and databases.</li>
<li><strong>Foundational infrastructure</strong>. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red Hat OpenShift with data routed through API management and events routed through business automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Optimization</strong> platform consisting of a Supply Assurance Control Panel, Fulfillment Optimization, and Inventory Analysis &amp; AI.</li>

<p><em>Figure 3. Schematic diagram of weather disruption preparation use case.</em></p>
<p>Weather disruption preparation workflow steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>External data feed, such as IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, anticipated disruptive environmental condition.
<li>Demand Intelligence system is alerted to the potential disruption.
<li>Inventory analysis anticipates potential low stock levels and predicts extraordinary demand levels
<li>Current inventory levels data collected
<li>Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions
<li>Control Tower alerts colleage with a set of work queues to mitigate the disrutpion Colleague takes remediation action by selecting actions provided by Control Tower.
<li>Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including:
<ol type="a">
<li>Ordering more stock in nearby and affected area.
<li>Adjusting stock positions within existing Supply Chain.
<li>Plan transport around affected area.
<li>Coordinate with suppliers and vendors to position inventory
</ol>
</ol>

<h3 id="disconnected-store">Disconnected store</h3>
<p>The following scenario shows how data can be transmitted from a store to the data center as part of an overall solution to setting up and maintaining the compute facilities in a store or branch office .</p>
<p><a href="../media/disconnectedstore-sd.png"><img alt="disconnected store" src="../media/disconnectedstore-sd.png" /></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 4. Schematic diagram of disaster response with a disconnected store use case.</em></p>
<p>Disconnected store workflow steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Point of sale devices send information to in-store server that collects transactions.
<li>Once connection is restored, store server queues events and plays them back as events. 
<li>The transaction events are read, business automation workflows are triggered to update corporate systems.
<li>Data is updated through business automation to:
<ol type="a">
<li>Adjust stock positions data for the affected stores.
<li>Update replentishment system.
<li>Upste store operations data.
<li>Consolidate data for to update work queue in Supply Chain Control Tower.
</ol>
</ol>
