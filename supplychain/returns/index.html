    <h1 id="returns">Returns</h1>
<p>Evolving customer expectations have forced retailers to figure out how to better manage the ripple effects that the current global crisis has created. This includes the realm of returns. </p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Manage return policies and manage customer expectations.</li>
<li>Minimizing return losses.</li>
<li>Categorize return items for recycle, dispose, or return for sales.</li>
<li>Determine fraudulent returns.</li>
<li>Identify and track teturns items with hazardous materials.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some of the trends that 2020 has seen so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended return windows: Many retailers have instituted extended return periods that go beyond the average 30-day window for customers.</li>
<li>Increased returns: With physical stores closed, ecommerce is on the rise. But with this shift comes increased returns, as customers can’t be certain what they’re buying online will be what the right size and fit.</li>
<li>Not accepting returns: In the face of health concerns around coronavirus lingering on surfaces for extended periods of time, some retailers have stopped accepting product returns at all.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-problem">Business problem</h2>
<p>Meet consumer demands by modernizing IT for the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business Drivers</h3>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Making returns easy for consumers is a way to create a loyal customer.</p>
<p><em>Minimizing returns losses</em> by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell the right item. One major step that eliminates a possible return is to make sure you sell the right item to the right customer. </li>
<li>Save the sale. The ‘save the sale’ method is key for businesses who are looking to compensate for returns through a loyalty incentive. </li>
<li>Smart returns. Smart returns will require a connected network of inventory visibility, as well as predicted demand.</li>
<li>Predict returns. Data plays a vital role when it comes to predicting returns. Specifically, data that tracks the reason for a return: whether it's done directly (item was damaged, didn’t fit, wasn’t as pictured, etc.) or learned through predictive analytics.</li>
<li>Buy online, pick up (or return) in-store. Retailers can give shoppers greater flexibility by allowing them to purchase online and then pick up in-store. While they’re there to pick up, they can test or try products they’ve ordered and make an exchange via curbside processing if needed.</li>
<li>Virtual or personal shopping. Whether it’s a virtual showcase of new items for your most loyal customers, or enabling sales associates to set aside items for shoppers based on their past purchase history, these tech-enabled shopping solutions should help lower the risk of returns.</li>
<li>Process returns quickly and efficiently, reducing the amount of time and employee hours spent.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Identify fraudulent returns</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Returning stolen merchandise</li>
<li>Receipt fraud</li>
<li>Employee fraud</li>
<li>Price switching</li>
<li>Price arbitrage</li>
<li>Switch fraud</li>
<li>Bricking</li>
<li>Cross-retail return</li>
<li>Open-box fraud</li>
<li>Wardrobing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase customer loyalty with appropriate returns policies</li>
<li>Minimizing returns losses</li>
<li>The return process is an opportunity to upsell</li>
<li>Identify fraudulent returns</li>
<li>Provide sustainable transport of returned items</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>The solution shown in Figure 1 uses components that can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core application systems</strong>. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management or facilities management. These systems can be standalone applications, on-premises and cloud services, and databases.</li>
<li><strong>Foundational infrastructure</strong>. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red Hat OpenShift with data routed through API management and events routed through business automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Optimization</strong> platform consisting of a Supply Assurance Control Panel, Fulfillment Optimization, and Inventory Analysis &amp; AI.</li>

<p>Returns workflow steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customer initiates return, provides reason at a kiosk, store, or mobile application
<li>Set customer expectation of refund, store credit, or upsell
<li>Business automation orchestrates, return item process
<ol type="a">
<li>Item is picked up and returns to a warehouse or store location
<li>The item is returned to a location
<li>Item is graded by inspector or automated inspection
</ol>
<li>Once it is determined usable or not, business automation takes steps to:
<ol type="a">
<li>Return the item in inventory for resell, adding it it to current inventory, store inventory or dispose of the item; identify the reason for the return
<li>Review for fraudulent return patterns
<li>Refund or provide store credit
</ol>
<li>Track return items through transport system
<ol type-"a">
<li>Track the order, notifying customer and provide real-time tracking
<li>Track order to disposal or repupose delivery location
<li>Track hazardous material to disposal
</ol>
</ol>
