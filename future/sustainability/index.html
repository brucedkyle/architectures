<h2 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business drivers</h2>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are several challenges to overcome in the pursuit of becoming a truly sustainable business:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer readiness</strong>. While the mindset around sustainability is shifting, no business can afford to be left behind, and few can financially afford to be too far ahead of the appetite for sustainable offerings. Co-creating a sustainable future requires a deep understanding of your customers and having partners with the right relationships and ecosystems to bring them along on the journey.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>. Implementing sustainable business practices typically requires higher upfront investments. In the short term, it will often be cheaper to stick with the status quo. Some organizations will need help building an investment case to show how immediate investment will result in more durable profitability over the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Systemic inertia</strong>. While sustainability is an important goal, it often isn’t seen as more important than other key priorities that may provide benefits sooner. Many businesses plan in ten-year increments, so while a 2050 commitment is good, it often isn’t enough to drive sufficient action in this decade, from a planning standpoint. It comes back to reframing risks as opportunities and building the case that acting on sustainability now is necessary to achieving future sustainability in business.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of tools, insights and expertise</strong>. Being unprepared to develop a corporate sustainability vision, strategy and framework is a monumental risk. Companies may lack the ability to implement sustainable solutions or even know where to start. Sustainability in business is evolving and so are the answers. Every business needs an ecosystem of innovation partners to help them reinvent the world and create a sustainable future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business drivers</strong></p>
<p>Sustainability is good for business.</p>
<p>Many of the world’s top economies have or are developing, corporate disclosure requirements around environmental impact, driving businesses to curb GHG emissions.</p>
<p>55% of consumers say environmental responsibility is very or extremely important when choosing a brand. Being known as a sustainable business can improve your brand awareness and help you attract consumers that are favorably predisposed to companies actively engaged in sustainable practices.</p>
<p>The rise of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment criteria and sustainable investing means that a sustainable business is inherently more attractive to the rising numbers of responsible investors. Investment in ESG assets may reach $53 trillion by 2025, representing over a third of global assets.</p>
<p>In 2021, we also found that half of consumers said they were willing to pay a premium for a sustainable brand or sustainable products. And this year, 49% of consumers say they’ve paid a premium—an average of 59% more—for products branded as sustainable or socially responsible in the last 12 months.</p>
