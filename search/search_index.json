We will start by defining the business problem and the two main use cases: understock and overstock, describe the challenges and business drivers organizations face. Next, we will provide an action guide, provide an overview of the solution, show a schematic of the two use cases: understock and overstock, and conclude with the technology used in the solution. For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see Inventory Optimization . Business problem Inventory optimization is a critical element of any retail organisation's fulfilment process. It represents a balancing act between two key viewpoints in the fulfilment process. The first viewpoint is demand . The business needs to understand their current demand for products, goods and services. There are two aspects of demand, the \u201ccurrent\u201d demand and the \u201cfuture\u201d demand. Current demand asks the question, \u201chow many unsatisfied orders or requests do we have in the system at this point in time?\u201d Future demand asks the more difficult question, \u201chow many orders or requests do we expect to have at some point in the future?\u201d This future point could be measured in minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and even years. The further into the future, the harder it becomes to predict the demand. The second viewpoint is inventory . The business needs to have a clear understanding of all the inventory held within their fulfilment system. An inventory management provides oversight of current inventory and inventory changes due to purchases. Performs analysis on sold products, keeps consolidated stock data, and handles stock allocation. Makes decision on reallocation of goods between multiple warehouses. Inventory is stock or inventory available for sale to customers. As with demand, inventory has two aspects, \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d inventory. Current inventory asks two questions, \u201chow many items of a particular product do I have available at this point in time?\u201d and \u201cwhere are those items located?\u201d Future inventory asks the question, \u201chow much inventory is required at some point in the future\u201d. As with demand, this future point could range from minutes to years and becomes increasingly harder to predict the further into the future. Inventory optimization is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory. Getting the balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business. Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and in the worst case, eventual collapse of the business. To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimization for any retail business, this document will focus on main use cases of demand and inventory. Use cases Two main issues are represented by demand risk. Understock - not holding sufficient inventory to meet current demand. This includes not having enough inventory today but also, not having enough inventory in the very near future that could be used to meet the demand. The end result is disappointed customers who order but don\u2019t get fulfillment or can\u2019t order due to lack of product. This \u201cstock out\u201d position often represents between 4-8% of total sales lost, but can also be a failed opportunity to satisfy customer in other ways, through up-sell and cross-sell. KPIs that can help avoid an under stock or stock-out position. include inventory turn over rate, days on hand and lead time (how long it takes to get more inventory from a supplier). Overstock - holding more stock than required to meet current and future demand. This results in additional costs to store then dispose of overstocked items via discounts, selling at a loss or destruction. Whilst understock is measured in customer satisfaction and loss of future opportunity, overstock has direct impact on the bottom-line costs and profitability of the business. KPIS relevant to overstock include, holding costs, dead stock (in-stock items failing to sell) and inventory turnover rates. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Stores receive inventory from warehouse or direct from suppliers. Managing direct ship is a real challenge for each store as it has to be managed at the store level. Maintaining inventory control of high value items to minimise loss and associated cost. Drivers Inventory turnover - if improve by 2 or 3 times then will drive bigger profit Managing capacity Initial costs - how much spending on warehouse and store to store-to-store inventory on shelf Responses Business Problem Solution Unusual events, such as the global pandemic, war or other international incident, port issues, and waterway obstructions illustrate the need for enterprises to build resilient supply chains. Respond with intelligence, speed, and confidence to reduce the impact of disruptions, turning these events into opportunities to outperform and outcompete. Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. Monitor and manage network inventory availability and respond to disruptions such as out-of-stock and overstock with alerts and recommended actions. The lack of pertinent product information and poor data flow across partners lead to inefficient inventory management, waste, and lost sales. Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each location. Action Guide From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain: Automation Systainability Modernization Actionable Step Implementation details Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation Integrate data from multiple systems to get enterprise-wide view of changes in inventory demand. Monitor and analyze near real-time data Accelerate automation in extended workflows As an example, in the Reduce out of stock (OOS) or approaching out of stock (AOOS) conditions, a SCIS Control Tower monitors inventory levels at all locations in a client's network and creates items in the work queue when revenue is at risk. Amp up AI to make workflows smarter When users are inspecting inventory items by drilling down on the item, users see where they have available inventory and receive recommendations about how much inventory can and should be transferred to the OOS / AOOS locations. These recommendations are based on adding automation and AI to make workflows smarter. Modernization for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms The decision for a future, Kubernetes-based enterprise platform is defining the standards for development, deployment and operations tools and processes for years to come and thus represents a foundational decision point. Solution overview This solution focuses on Automation and Modernization in our Action Guide as shown in the following diagram: Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation. Accelerate automation in extended workflows Amp up AI to make workflows smarter Modernize for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram: Core application systems.

Inventory Optimization platform Understock The following diagram shows the schematic for the understock use case. Understock workflow steps: Inventory Analysis detects low stock levels and predicts inventory will become unavailable sooner than originally expected. Inventory Control Tower alerted to the understock position. Inventory Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions Inventory Control Tower collects future demand requirements from Demand Intelligence. Colleague alerted and asked to take remediation action. Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: Ordering more stock Adjusting stock positions within existing Supply Chain Managing inventory held at existing stores or by moving existing inventory Managing inventory held at existing warehouses or by moving existing inventory Overstock The following diagram shows the schematic for the overstock use case. Overstock workflow steps: Inventory Analysis detects high stock levels and predicts inventory will not be sold as quickly as expected. Inventory Control Tower alerted to the overstock position. Inventory Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions. Inventory Control Tower collects future demand requirements from Demand Intelligence. Colleague alerted and asked to take remediation action. Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: Product discounting and promotions. Adjust stock positions within stores by moving stock between stores or warehouses to accelerate sales in conjunction with promotions. Reduce future inventory requirements to slow down or stop replenishment. Offering stock to partners for liquidation, destruction, donation, sale via alternative channels or to food-waste partners.

Inventory management encompasses procedures and processes that directly or indirectly affect the bottom line ordering, receiving, storing, tracking and accounting for all of the goods a business sells. It is a key element of supply chain management. In this scenario, you will explore the implications of a perfect and imperfect order in which inventory: Can meet customer expecation. May not have all items available. Business problem Inventory visibility . Multichannel order fulfillment operations typically have inventory spread across many places throughout the supply chain. Inventory visibility is knowing what inventory you have and where it\u2019s located. Businesses need an accurate view of inventory to guarantee fulfillment of customer orders, reduce shipment turnaround times, and minimize stockouts, oversells and markdowns. Orders may not match available inventory . Inventory may not be on hand or in a different location than expected. Multiple and partial shipments may be able to solve many customer requests. Business solution The goal of inventory management is to have the right products in the right place at the right time. This requires inventory visibility \u2014 knowing when to order, how much to order and where to store stock. The basic steps of inventory management include: Purchasing inventory . Ready-to-sell goods are purchased and delivered to the warehouse or directly to the point of sale. Storing inventory . Inventory is stored until needed. Goods or materials are transferred across your fulfillment network until ready for shipment. Profiting from inventory . The amount of product for sale is controlled. Finished goods are pulled to fulfill orders. Products are shipped to customers. Use cases More and more businesses are looking at having sustainable supply chains because customers are demanding it. Use case Problem statement Solution Stock on hand Inventory visibility What goods are in stock, how much do you have and where are the items? All that information is required to fill orders. An Inventory management system helps provide that information and more. Forecasting for fulfillment / Demand forecasting Forecasting Forecasting is predicting how much inventory you\u2019ll need on hand to meet upcoming demand. Goal of forecasting is to have just enough inventory on hand to cover predicted sales for a prescribed period of time. Optimal inventory Monitor Orders Inventory By minimizing lost sales, misplaced stock and excess ordering, inventory management boosts your profits and can even reduce your taxes. Optimal inventory level is the ideal quantity of product that one should have in a fulfillment center(s) at any given time. By optimizing inventory levels, you reduce the risk of common inventory issues, from high storage costs to out-of-stock items. Warehouse location Inside the Warehouse refers to the specific spot, such as a shelf or a bin, where a product is located within the four walls of a warehouse. It impacts the efficiency and timeliness of picking products. The products most often picked is placed in the most efficient spot. As products change and demand for products changes, the inventory layout can be updated to ensure continued efficiency. Warehouse location Physical Location of the Warehouse Choosing the site for a warehouse is based on many factors: Rent Rates Taxes Workforce Availability, Labor Skills Costs Access Roads, Highways Traffic Flow Proximity to Airport, Railway Stations Ports Proximity to Markets Local Environment Building Availability Utility Costs Building intelligent Benefits Decrease waste . Decrease order fragmentation and waste with decrease in packages per order. Order optimization . In-stock improvement through holiday season using Order Optimizer. Reduce costs . Reduced costs and emissions by housing software on the cloud more efficiently than on-premises Minimize disruption . Gain visibility to minimize disruption to business despite supply and demand shocks Returns optimization . Returns refurbished to create a revenue stream by re-circulation, refurbishment, repairs thereby reducing disposal and recycling costs. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Spreadsheets, hand-counted stock levels and manual order placement have largely been replaced by advanced inventory tracking software. An inventory management system can simplify the process of ordering, storing and using inventory by automating end-to-end production, business management, demand forecasting and accounting. Drivers Supply chain operators will use technologies that provide significant insights into how supply chain performance can be improved. They\u2019ll anticipate anomalies in logistics costs and performance before they occur and have insights into where automation can deliver significant scale advantages. Have an accurate assessment of critical spares and the money invested in those parts Deliver transparency and visibility to critical and non-critical spares inventory for the organization Eliminate \u201cout of stock\u201d occurrences Reduce time spent looking for and ordering parts Reduce dormant/non-moving inventory Accelerate disposal of obsolete materials Improve stock allocation to improve space utilization Optimizes inventory costs by balancing inventory to operational demand Action guide From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain: Automation Systainability Modernization Actionable Step Implementation details Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation Integrate data from multiple systems to get enterprise-wide view of changes in inventory demand. Monitor and analyze near real-time data Monitor the criticality of inventory items to the organization Some are critical to operations or employee safety. Others are \u201cnice to have\u201d but not urgent. Select a methodology and a solution that routinely audit those parameters. For example, any time a new transaction is created in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), the solution needs to apply that transaction against the material to determine if the criticality is still correct. Automate the maintenance of scores to each individual item Eliminate data manual entry for criticality with a systems wide approach Accelerate automation in extended workflows Automate the response using workflows that are consistant with criticality of the inventory items Provide visibility into the inventory system When users are inspecting inventory items, users can see where they have available inventory and receive recommendations about how much inventory can and should be transferred to the OOS / AOOS locations.

Multichannel order fulfillment operations typically have inventory spread across many places throughout the supply chain. Inventory visibility is knowing what inventory you have and where it\u2019s located. Businesses need an accurate view of inventory to guarantee fulfillment of customer orders, reduce shipment turnaround times, and minimize stockouts, oversells and markdowns. Orders may not match available inventory . Inventory may not be on hand or in a different location than expected.

Use case Problem statement Solution Stock on hand Inventory visibility What goods are in stock, how much do you have and where are the items? All that information is required to fill orders. An Inventory management system helps provide that information and more. Forecasting for fulfillment / Demand forecasting Forecasting Forecasting is predicting how much inventory you\u2019ll need on hand to meet upcoming demand. Goal of forecasting is to have just enough inventory on hand to cover predicted sales for a prescribed period of time. Optimal inventory Monitor Orders Inventory By minimizing lost sales, misplaced stock and excess ordering, inventory management boosts your profits and can even reduce your taxes. Optimal inventory level is the ideal quantity of product that one should have in a fulfillment center(s) at any given time. By optimizing inventory levels, you reduce the risk of common inventory issues, from high storage costs to out-of-stock items. Warehouse location Inside the Warehouse refers to the specific spot, such as a shelf or a bin, where a product is located within the four walls of a warehouse. It impacts the efficiency and timeliness of picking products. The products most often picked is placed in the most efficient spot. As products change and demand for products changes, the inventory layout can be updated to ensure continued efficiency.

Typically these events are external factors forced upon the business and cannot always be planned or predicted. To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimization for any business, we will focus on two main use cases of an unanticipated exception: Environment Exceptions such as power outages or temperature changes that creates potential spoilage Product contamination or recall such as foreign objects or bacteria occuring earlier in the processing or supply chain We will start by defining the business problem and the two main use cases: Environmental Exceptions and Product contamination or recall, describe the challenges and business drivers organizations face. Next, we will provide an action guide, provide an overview of the solution, show a schematic of the two use cases: Environmental Exceptions and Product contamination or recall, and conclude with the technology used in the solution. For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see Inventory Optimization . Business problem Loss and waste management is principally focused on ensuring food and food related products remain fit for consumption at the time they are sold to the end consumer. However, external factors outside the control of the business can cause food items to be marked as spoiled or damaged. The problem faced by the business is ensuring the overall loss and wastage is minimised. To prevent spoilage, food products must typically be stored and transported at temperatures within well defined ranges. For example: - Frozen food must be kept below a specific temperature (0\u00b0F) at all times. If the temperature rises and food defrosts, it cannot be refrozen. - Chilled food must be kept within a temperature range (34\u00b0F - 39\u00b0F). The temperature can sometimes go above the higher limit for a short space of time before returning to the correct temperature, without becoming spoiled. If the high temperature is exceeded for a specified duration it must be considered spoiled. - Shelf stable food does not require chilling, but needs to be stored withing a temperature range to ensure the product shelf life is maintained. A shelf stable food product's shelf life can be 6 weeks to 5 years, depending on the product. To keep food at the correct temperature, refrigeration and chilling during transport and storage are the primary options. Power outages will happen. The ability to deal with the situation within well defined time periods is critical to ensuring the loss and wastage is minimised. If the problem can be rectified quickly and easily, there is every chance the product can remain in perfect conditiona and be sold to a consumer. Failure to act quickly will result in spoilage and loss of the product. Between farm and end consumer, food products generally go through multiple stages which vary depending on the end product. For convenience foods, there can be several manufuacturing steps, for fresh produce packaging and transport are the main stages. At any stage in the process, there is a possibility of contamination through foreign objects or bacteria. Both of which can trigger a recall of the food products. With any kind of contamination, a fast and efficient recall process to prevent the products beng purchased by consumers is vital. All retailers handing and selling food products need processes to reduce food waste through external factors and ensure recall procedures in the event of contamination are fast, efficient and minimise any risk to public health. Use cases The main use cases represented by loss management are: Environmental Exceptions an environmental issue or problem places the food product at risk. If the issue is not dealt with quickly and efficiently the product will be spoiled making unavailable for sale to a consumer. Typically this would be a failure of refrigeration equipment or a loss of power to refrigeration euipment. If the temperature can be kept within a specific range, the product will remain suitable for sale to a consumer. If the temperature moves beyond the specified range for a set period of time, the product will be considered spoiled and no longer suitable for sale to a consumer. Product contamination or recall a contamination or recall requires the food product to be removed immediately from the inventory and supply chain. The contamination issue or recall notice can come from external parties such as suppliers or food standards agencies, or through the retailer identifying an issue. Once the issue has been identified, the reatiler must immediately remove all affected products from their own inventory and supply chain, then destroy or pass the product to a third party. The issue can be caused by foreign objects or the detection of selected bateria in the product. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Protect public health: Businesses that sell consumable products are expected to protect the public health by implementing specific processes to address food safety. Maintaining equipment that refrigerates or freezes food or pharmaceutical products for storage until purchase or combined into a recipe and responding to and documenting actions taken to a food safety recall notification by either the supplier or regulatory body are key challenges. Regulatory compliance: Business that sell consumable products are expected to comply with local, state, and federal regulatory requirements for food and pharmaceutical products. Automated documentation of compliance is preferred over manual, error-prone documentation. Drivers Industry leading inventory management system, incorporating sensors that can mitigate risks before they create an exposure. Integrating loss and waste management into the core supply chain applications, leveraging technical investments in modern infrastructures and edge devices. Protect Reputation Avoid Penalties and fines Responses All businesses that require a supply chain have unanticipated issues. Business problem Solution Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. Monitor and manage network inventory availability and anticipate actions due to unanticipated exception with alerts and recommended actions Business process for handling unexpected issues may not be consistent across the enterprise Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each location and provide transparency to inventory. Enable actionable inventory shifts across the enterprise Visibility into actions needed and alternatives to anticipate and respond to inventory in an unanticipated event.

The items must be made available in a suitable timeframe, at the correct location and in an acceptable condition. Fulfilment optimization takes the fulfillment process a step further by using information and knowledge about the supply chain, inventory and stock positions to ensure any promises made to the customer are met or exceeded. A key element of the retail fulfilment process is knowing the inventory position. This is the amount of stock available for sale to a customer, it\u2019s location and the time it takes to make it available to the customer. Inventory optimization is a collection of best practices for ensuring the retail organisation maintains complete and accurate stock levels whilst balancing customer demand against current and future stock levels. In this overview, we will discuss the business challenges, business value, and business outcomes and then provide automation and modernization actionable steps organizations can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain. These are based on The Action Guide in Own your transformation survey of 1500 CSCOs across 24 industries. Actionable steps will be developed through the lens of use cases on how the main risk factors can be transformed: Demand Risk (under stock and over stock) Loss and waste management Product timeliness Inventory management Last mile delivery We will then give an overview of the solution, reference architecture, logical diagram, and how these capabilities are realized by technology capabilities. Business challenges Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCOs) face issues related to supply chain disruptions, technology infrastructure, sustainability, and market shifts as their greatest challenges. Yet when addressed with an open mindset, challenges create opportunities within the enterprise\u2014and visibility. Harvard Business Review article, Three steps to prepare your supply chain for the next crisis . reports: Companies that are well prepared and as a result prosper in a crisis can expect to recover more quickly than their competitors. In a review of corporate performance during the past four U.S. downturns (since 1985), Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that 14% of companies increased their sales and their profit margin. Investors are starting to reward companies that build for the future by becoming more innovative and more resilient. In June 2020, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, BCG surveyed major institutional investors and found that nine out of ten believed it was \"important for healthy companies to prioritize the building of business capabilities \u2014 even if it means lowering earnings-per-share guidance or delivering below consensus.\" The McKinsey report How COVID-19 is reshaping supply chains explains that companies found it was easier to increase inventories than implement their preferred strategy of nearshoring or regionalization. In addition, \"The proactive monitoring of supplier risks was the primary focus \u2026, yet significant blind spots remain in most companies\u2019 supply-chain risk-management setups. Just under half of the companies in our survey say they understand the location of their tier-one suppliers and the key risks those suppliers face.\" Enhanced customer experiences, improved profitability, and more predictive forecasts are high on CSCOs' priority lists according to a report by IBM Institute for Business Value, Own your transformation: Data-led innovation for the modern supply chain . Business value Inventory optimization is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory across the enterprise. Getting the balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business. Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and in the worst case, eventual collapse of the business. Business outcomes According to the IBM IBV study , innovators track well ahead of their peers when it comes to AI-enabled workflows for risk management and to handle other predictions. And they expect continued development of these workflows and other capabilities over the next three years. Right now, Innovator CSCOs report developing digitized workflows and leveraging AI automation a full 95% more than their peers. Innovators also stand out by leveraging data with AI and advanced analytics in demand management. With demand volatility and associated supplier, operations, and logistics disruption at all-time highs, CSCOs are applying AI and machine learning to the critical and strategic continuous planning elements of demand management and forecasting. A full 90% of Innovators use AI and advanced analytics in demand management and predictive forecasting, 18% more than their peers (76%). Directly influence the following KPIs: Improve lost sales from stock out 4-8% Solution cost savings 10% Increase stock turnover Reduce days on hand Manage lead time (may be leading indicator of stock overage) Reduce holding cost Manage product at risk/perishability/age Improve gross margin return on investment Reduce return rate Black swan events. Manage unusual events regarding weather, natural disaster, supply chain interruption. Improve customer satisfaction Action guide From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain. Automation Accelerate automation in extended workflows Amp up AI to make workflows smarter Cultivate collaborative ecosystems Sustainability Link environmental and social initiatives with business solutions Optimize workflows with AI to manage carbon, waste, energy, and water consumption Compete with new sustainable products and services Modernization Architect modern infrastructures Scale hybrid cloud platforms Increase awareness of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and solutions For specific steps on this approach, see The Action Guide in Own your transformation survey of 1500 CSCOs across 24 industries. Scenarios To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimization for any business, several articles outline main use cases on how the main risk factors can be transformed: Inventory management - Perfect or Imperfect Order Inventory risk - Demand risk Inventory risk - Loss and waste management Inventory risk - Product timeliness Inventory management - Last mile delivery Inventory risk - Timeliness Inventory management Perfect / Imprefect order Inventory may not be on hand or in a different location than expected. Multiple and partial shipments may be able to solve many customer requests. The business can respond to the imperfect order and increase customer responsiveness with: Intelligent promising Optmization user expectations with improved demand forecasting Automated responses For more information and solution details on this scenario, see Inventory management Perfect/Imperfect order Inventory Risk Demand Risk Understock - not holding sufficient inventory to meet current demand. This includes not having enough inventory today but also, not having enough inventory in the very near future that could be used to meet the demand. Overstock - holding more stock than required to meet current and future demand. This results in additional costs to store then dispose of overstocked items via discounts, selling at a loss or destruction. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Inventory Optimization - Demand Risk . Inventory Risk Loss and waste management Loss and waste management requires you to take decisive action in cases of: Shelf life . Identify and timely replace items as shelf life expires. NOTE: this is covered in Product timeliness Environmental exceptions . Food expirations, power interruption or other disaster affecting the product salability. Contamination or recall . Quickly identify, remove contaminated and recalled items from sale or items that have a contaminated component. Proactively provide safe alternative or replacement when safe. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Inventory Optimization - Loss and waste management . Inventory management Last mile delivery If the last mile delivery promise is incorrect and a product arrives late, there\u2019s a good chance that the customer will shop with a competitor next time. If last mile tracking information is incorrect, a product arrives late, is damaged, or is never delivered, there\u2019s a good chance that the customer will shop with a competitor next time. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Inventory management - Last mile delivery . Inventory Risk Product timeliness Product timeliness is having goods and products in the right place at the right time, packed correctly and in line with customer expectations. This risk is particular to seasonal goods, fast fashion, drugs, cosmetics, grocery and food supply industry. KPIs relevant to product timeliness include dead stock and inventory days on hand. Shelf life defines a set of actions to be taken with products that expire on specific dates and must be removed from use or sale. For example, food can expire and need to be removed from shelves. Timeliness defines a set of actions that can be taken when products expire, but that may be still have some benefit. For example, seasonality of clothing can be warehoused until the following year. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Inventory Optimization - Product timeliness .

The items must be made available in a suitable timeframe, at the correct location and in an acceptable condition. Fulfilment optimization takes the fulfillment process a step further by using information and knowledge about the supply chain, inventory and stock positions to ensure any promises made to the customer are met or exceeded. A key element of the retail fulfilment process is knowing the inventory position. This is the amount of stock available for sale to a customer, it\u2019s location and the time it takes to make it available to the customer. Inventory optimization is a collection of best practices for ensuring the retail organisation maintains complete and accurate stock levels whilst balancing customer demand against current and future stock levels. In this overview, we will discuss the business challenges, business value, and business outcomes and then provide automation and modernization actionable steps organizations can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain.

In a review of corporate performance during the past four U.S. downturns (since 1985), Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that 14% of companies increased their sales and their profit margin. Investors are starting to reward companies that build for the future by becoming more innovative and more resilient. In June 2020, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, BCG surveyed major institutional investors and found that nine out of ten believed it was \"important for healthy companies to prioritize the building of business capabilities \u2014 even if it means lowering earnings-per-share guidance or delivering below consensus.\" The McKinsey report How COVID-19 is reshaping supply chains explains that companies found it was easier to increase inventories than implement their preferred strategy of nearshoring or regionalization.

Manufactured parts and goods also experience decay and deterioriation. Each of these may be measured. In the food industry, you may see different terms and date types on the packaging, the following are common practices and their meanings according to the USDA and FDA as explained in Expiring Products \u2013 Food Ingredients by Michigan State University: Best if used by/before: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality Use by: on any food OTHER than infant formula, this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality. If \u201cused by\u201d is present on infant formula, it\u2019s an expiration date, and you should discard the infant formula after the use by date. Sell by: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality Freeze by: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food should be frozen to maintain the best quality Expiration or EXP: this is an expiration date and usually only found on infant formula and some baby foods Guaranteed fresh: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality Other products, particularly pharmaceuticals, must be used within specific time frames to be warantted or to be considered safe and effective. Manufactured parts may be warranteed for specific periods or number of uses. For example, manufactured parts must be replaced when outside of certain tolerances. Some products may still continue to be useful beyond their expiration date or use. For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see Inventory Optimization . Business problem Product liability claims can wreck a business. Defects and liability risks affect product manufacturers, designers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. Physical or digital items that omit adequate warnings, injure a third party, or cause a wrongful death can lead to lawsuits for any party involved in the product. Use Cases How should a business track and respond to issues? Responding to Shelf life defines a set of actions to be taken with products that expire on specific dates and must be removed from use or sale. For example, food can expire and need to be removed from shelves. Timeliness defines a set of actions that can be taken when products expire, but that may be still have some benefit. For example, seasonality of clothing can be warehoused until the following year. In both shelf life and timeliness, you will want to plan and to take proactive steps in anticipation of product expirations. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Tracking items for shelf life and timeliness Taking actions, such as product removal, replacement, work order tracking to demonstrate the product is handled with due care Drivers Public safety Product liability claims Demonstrating due diligence for safety Responses Many goods offered in retail and supplier businesses expire. Business problem Solution Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. Monitor and manage network inventory availability and anticipate actions due to expiration of products with alerts and recommended actions. The lack of pertinent product information (remaining shelf life, ambient temperature, etc.) and poor data flow across partners lead to inefficient inventory management, wastage and lost sales. Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each location \u2013 e.g., by remaining shelf life, time-since-harvested. Maintain freshness by acting on alerts received when items are at risk. Visibility into actions needed and alternatives to anticipate and respond to inventory as items approach end of shelf life. Provide actionable tasks, work orders, visibility for workers and supply chain partners to remove end of life items. Proactively replace items in response to demand. Solution overview This solution focuses on Automation and Modernization in our Action Guide as shown in the following diagram: Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation. Accelerate automation in extended workflows Amp up AI to make workflows smarter Modernize for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram: Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on RedHat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop. Inventory Optimization platform Solution Principles True end-to-end visibility . Remove data silos and create a unified view across supply chain data with a standard data platform. Personalized dashboards and insights provide a 360-degreee view of KPIs and significant events. Manage by exception . Detect, display, and prioritize work tasks in real time. This allows clients to sense and react to issues quickly while managing risks and disruptions in a supply chain proactively. Intelligent workflows . Actionable workflows can be customized to meet unique requirements and process steps required to automate actions within source transactional systems. Make informed decisions with a supply chain virtual assistant that provides responses to issues based on a client\u2019s supply chain data using natural language search. Timeliness/Shelf life The following diagram shows the schematic for the Timeliness/Shelf life use case. Timeliness/Shelf life steps: Inventory Control Tower hueristics determines product inventory is near its \"Use by\" date Inspects current inventory Notifies the Inventory Controller to take action Creates replenishment order Engages partners (Charity, recycler) to remediate expired or near expired stock Action Guide From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain: Automation Systainability Modernization Actionable Step Implementation details Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation Integrate data from multiple systems to get enterprise-wide view of changes in inventory demand. Monitor and analyze near real-time data Accelerate automation in extended workflows Business automation provides a systematic way to notifications, documentation of notifications, and creation of work orders. Amp up AI to make workflows smarter For expiring products, Control Tower monitors inventory levels at all locations in a client\u2019s network and creates items in the work queue when revenue is at risk. When drilling down on the item, users can see where they have available inventory and receive recommendations about how much inventory can and should be ordered for replacement based on demand. Modernization for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms The decision for a future, Kubernetes-based enterprise platform is defining the standards for development, deployment and operations tools and processes for years to come and thus represents a foundational decision point.

In the food industry, you may see different terms and date types on the packaging, the following are common practices and their meanings according to the USDA and FDA as explained in Expiring Products \u2013 Food Ingredients by Michigan State University: Best if used by/before: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality Use by: on any food OTHER than infant formula, this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality. If \u201cused by\u201d is present on infant formula, it\u2019s an expiration date, and you should discard the infant formula after the use by date. Sell by: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality Freeze by: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food should be frozen to maintain the best quality Expiration or EXP: this is an expiration date and usually only found on infant formula and some baby foods Guaranteed fresh: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality Other products, particularly pharmaceuticals, must be used within specific time frames to be warantted or to be considered safe and effective. Manufactured parts may be warranteed for specific periods or number of uses. For example, manufactured parts must be replaced when outside of certain tolerances. Some products may still continue to be useful beyond their expiration date or use.

Responding to Shelf life defines a set of actions to be taken with products that expire on specific dates and must be removed from use or sale. For example, food can expire and need to be removed from shelves. Timeliness defines a set of actions that can be taken when products expire, but that may be still have some benefit. For example, seasonality of clothing can be warehoused until the following year. In both shelf life and timeliness, you will want to plan and to take proactive steps in anticipation of product expirations.","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"sustainability/timeliness/#challenges-business-drivers","text":"Challenges Tracking items for shelf life and timeliness Taking actions, such as product removal, replacement, work order tracking to demonstrate the product is handled with due care Drivers Public safety Product liability claims Demonstrating due diligence for safety","title":"Challenges / Business Drivers"},{"location":"sustainability/timeliness/#responses","text":"Many goods offered in retail and supplier businesses expire. Business problem Solution Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. Monitor and manage network inventory availability and anticipate actions due to expiration of products with alerts and recommended actions. The lack of pertinent product information (remaining shelf life, ambient temperature, etc.) and poor data flow across partners lead to inefficient inventory management, wastage and lost sales. Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each location \u2013 e.g., by remaining shelf life, time-since-harvested. Maintain freshness by acting on alerts received when items are at risk. Visibility into actions needed and alternatives to anticipate and respond to inventory as items approach end of shelf life.
