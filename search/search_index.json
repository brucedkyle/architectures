For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see Inventory Optimisation . Business problem Inventory optimisation is a critical element of any retail organisation's fulfilment process. It represents a balancing act between two key viewpoints in the fulfilment process. The first viewpoint is demand . The business needs to understand their current demand for products, goods and services. There are two aspects of demand, the \u201ccurrent\u201d demand and the \u201cfuture\u201d demand. Current demand asks the question, \u201chow many unsatisfied orders or requests do we have in the system at this point in time?\u201d Future demand asks the more difficult question, \u201chow many orders or requests do we expect to have at some point in the future?\u201d This future point could be measured in minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and even years. The further into the future, the harder it becomes to predict the demand. The second viewpoint is inventory . The business needs to have a clear understanding of all the inventory held within their fulfilment system. This is stock or inventory available for sale to customers. As with demand, inventory has two aspects, \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d inventory. Current inventory asks two questions, \u201chow many items of a particular product do I have available at this point in time?\u201d and \u201cwhere are those items located?\u201d Future inventory asks the question, \u201chow much inventory is required at some point in the future\u201d. As with demand, this future point could range from minutes to years and becomes increasingly harder to predict the further into the future. Inventory optimisation is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory. Getting the balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business. Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and in the worst case, eventual collapse of the business. To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimisation for any retail business, this document will focus on main use cases of demand and inventory. Use cases Two main issues are represented by demand risk. Under stocking - not holding sufficient inventory to meet current demand. This includes not having enough inventory today but also, not having enough inventory in the very near future that could be used to meet the demand. The end result is disappointed customers who order but don\u2019t get fulfillment or can\u2019t order due to lack of product. This \u201cstock out\u201d position often represents between 4-8% of total sales lost, but can also be a failed opportunity to satisfy customer in other ways, through up-sell and cross-sell. KPIs that can help avoid an under stock or stock-out position. include inventory turn over rate, days on hand and lead time (how long it takes to get more inventory from a supplier). Over stocking - holding more stock than required to meet current and future demand. This results in additional costs to store then dispose of overstocked items via discounts, selling at a loss or destruction. Whilst under stocking is measured in customer satisfaction and loss of future opportunity, over stocking has direct impact on the bottom line costs and profitability of the business. KPIS relevant to over stocking include, holding costs, dead stock (in-stock items failing to sell) and inventory turnover rates. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges . Stores receive inventory from warehouse or direct from suppliers. Managing direct ship is a real challenge for each store as it has to be managed at the store level. Maintaining inventory control of high value items to minimise loss and associated cost. Driver Inventory turnover - if improve by 2 or 3 times then will drive bigger profit Managing cap Inital costs - how much spending on warehouse and store to storeinventory on shelf Responses Business Problem Solution Unusual events, such as the global pandemic, war or other international incident, port issues, and waterway obstructions illustrate the need for enterprises to build resilient supply chains. Respond with intelligence, speed, and confidence to reduce the impact of disruptions, turning these events into opportunities to outperform and outcompete. Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. Monitor and manage network inventory availability and respond to disruptions such as out-of-stock and overstock with alerts and recommended actions. The lack of pertinent product information and poor data flow across partners lead to inefficient inventory management, waste, and lost sales. Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each location. Solution overview The technologies can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram: Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on RedHat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop. Inventory Optimisation platform Understock The following diagram shows the workflow for the understock use case. Understock workflow steps: Inventory Analysis detects low stock levels and predicts inventory will become unavailable sooner than originally expected. Inventory Control Tower alerted to the understock position. Inventory Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions Inventory Control Tower collects future demand requirements from Demand Intelligence. Colleague alerted and asked to take remediation action. Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: Ordering more stock Adjusting stock positions within existing Supply Chain Managing inventory held at existing stores or by moving existing inventory Managing inventory held at existing warehouses or by moving existing inventory The following diagram shows the schematic for the understock use case. Overstock The following diagram shows the workflow for the overstock use case. Overstock workflow steps: Inventory Analysis detects high stock levels and predicts inventory will not be sold as quickly as expected. Inventory Control Tower alerted to the overstock position. Inventory Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions. Inventory Control Tower collects future demand requirements from Demand Intelligence. Colleague alerted and asked to take remediation action. Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: Product discounting and promotions. Adjust stock positions within stores by moving stock between stores or warehouses to accelerate sales in conjunction with promotions. Reduce future inventory requirements to slow down or stop replenishment. Offering stock to partners for liquidation, destruction, donation, sale via alternative channels or to food-waste partners. The following diagram shows the schematic for the overstock use case. Technology The following technology was chosen for this solution: Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes offering, the hybrid platform offering allow deployment across data centers, private and public clouds as it brings choices and flexible for hosting system and services.

Use Case The Problem The Solution The Benefits and Implications Reduce out of stock (OOS) or approaching out of stock (AOOS)conditions Out of stock situations lead to lost revenue and decreased brand / retailer loyalty. SCIS Control Tower monitors inventory levels at all locations in a client's network and creates items in the work queue when revenue is at risk. When drilling down on the item, users can see where they have available inventory and receive recommendations about how much inventory can and should be transferred to the OOS / AOOS locations. Action can be taken directly from the Control Tower user interface. OOS situations are efficiently managed and AOOS are avoided with minimal human intervention. Manage industrial and manufacturing critical supplies Out of stock situations lead to line outages, manufacturing delays, and lost revenue. SCIS Control Tower monitors inventory to requested demand and creates items in the work queue when delivery is at risk. When drilling down on the item, users can see parts by SKU and location to see which supply is at risk take action to minimize impact. Minimize production and parts impact due to OOS / AOOS situations. Increase throughput and minimize customer delays. Minimize expedited and remediation costs. Inventory is managed by exception. Manage and predict inventory exceptions such as: low inventory, stockouts, slow moving and aging inventory. Optimize inventory transfers to mitigate these circumstances.

The items must be made available in a suitable timeframe, at the correct location and in an acceptable condition. Fulfilment optimisation takes the fulfillment process a step further by using information and knowledge about the supply chain, inventory and stock positions to ensure any promises made to the customer are met or exceeded. A key element of the retail fulfilment process is knowing the inventory position. This is the amount of stock available for sale to a customer, it\u2019s location and the time it takes to make it available to the customer. Inventory optimisation is a collection of best practices for ensuring the retail organisation maintains complete and accurate stock levels whilst balancing customer demand against current and future stock levels. Business challenges Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCOs) face issues related to supply chain disruptions, technology infrastructure, sustainability, and market shifts as their greatest challenges. Yet when addressed with an open mindset, challenges create opportunities within the enterprise\u2014and visibility. Harvard Business Review article, Three steps to prepare your supply chain for the next crisis . reports: Companies that are well prepared and as a result prosper in a crisis can expect to recover more quickly than their competitors. In a review of corporate performance during the past four U.S. downturns (since 1985), Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that 14% of companies increased their sales and their profit margin. Investors are starting to reward companies that build for the future by becoming more innovative and more resilient. In June 2020, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, BCG surveyed major institutional investors and found that nine out of ten believed it was \"important for healthy companies to prioritize the building of business capabilities \u2014 even if it means lowering earnings-per-share guidance or delivering below consensus.\" The McKinsey report How COVID-19 is reshaping supply chains explains that companies found it was easier to increase inventories than implement their preferred strategy of nearshoring or regionalization. In addition, \"The proactive monitoring of supplier risks was the primary focus \u2026, yet significant blind spots remain in most companies\u2019 supply-chain risk-management setups. Just under half of the companies in our survey say they understand the location of their tier-one suppliers and the key risks those suppliers face.\" Enhanced customer experiences, improved profitability, and more predictive forecasts are high on CSCOs' priority lists according to a report by IBM Institute for Business Value, Own your transformation: Data-led innovation for the modern supply chain . Business value Inventory optimisation is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory across the enterprise. Getting the balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business. Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and in the worst case, eventual collapse of the business. Business outcomes Innovators track well ahead of their peers when it comes to AI-enabled workflows for risk management and to handle other predictions. And they expect continued development of these workflows and other capabilities over the next three years. Right now, Innovator CSCOs report developing digitized workflows and leveraging AI automation a full 95% more than their peers. Innovators also stand out by leveraging data with AI and advanced analytics in demand management. With demand volatility and associated supplier, operations, and logistics disruption at all-time highs, CSCOs are applying AI and machine learning to the critical and strategic continuous planning elements of demand management and forecasting. A full 90% of Innovators use AI and advanced analytics in demand management and predictive forecasting, 18% more than their peers (76%). Directly influence the following KPIs: Improve lost sales from stock out 4-8% Solution cost savings 10% Increase stock turnover Reduce days on hand Manage lead time (may be leading indicator of stock overage) Reduce holding cost Manage product at risk/perishability/age Improve gross margin return on investment Reduce return rate Black swan events. Manage unusual events regarding weather, natural disaster, supply chain interuption. Improve customer satisfaction Action guide From a high-level perspective\u2014several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain.

Scenarios To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimisation for any business, several articles outline main use cases on how the main risk factors can be transformed: Demand risk Loss and waste management Product timeliness Demand Risk Under stocking - not holding sufficient inventory to meet current demand. This includes not having enough inventory today but also, not having enough inventory in the very near future that could be used to meet the demand. Over stocking - holding more stock than required to meet current and future demand. This results in additional costs to store then dispose of overstocked items via discounts, selling at a loss or destruction. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Inventory Optimisation - Demand Risk . Inventory Risk - Loss and waste management Loss and waste management - take decisive action in cases of: Shelf life. Identify and timely replace items as shelf life expires. Environmental exception. Food expirations, power interruption or other disaster affecting the product salability. Contamination or recall. Quickly identify, remove contaminated and recalled items from sale or items that have a contaminated component. Proactively provide safe alternative or replacement when safe. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Inventory Optimisation - Loss management . Inventory Risk - Product timeliness Product timeliness - having goods and products in the right place at the right time, packed correctly and in line with customer expectations. This risk is particular to seasonal goods, fast fashion, drugs, cosmetics, grocery and food supply industry. KPIs relevant to product timeliness include dead stock and inventory days on hand. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Inventory Optimisation - Product timeliness . Overview This solution focuses on Automation and Modernization in our Action Guide as shown in the following diagram: Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation. Modernization for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms. Specifically, Harvard Business Review article recommends: CEOs need to invest in risk intelligence and strategic foresight, creating a team of procurement super-forecasters equipped with the latest artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered sensing technology.

The items must be made available in a suitable timeframe, at the correct location and in an acceptable condition. Fulfilment optimisation takes the fulfillment process a step further by using information and knowledge about the supply chain, inventory and stock positions to ensure any promises made to the customer are met or exceeded. A key element of the retail fulfilment process is knowing the inventory position. This is the amount of stock available for sale to a customer, it\u2019s location and the time it takes to make it available to the customer. Inventory optimisation is a collection of best practices for ensuring the retail organisation maintains complete and accurate stock levels whilst balancing customer demand against current and future stock levels.","title":"Inventory Optimization Overview"},{"location":"sustainability/inventory/#business-challenges","text":"Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCOs) face issues related to supply chain disruptions, technology infrastructure, sustainability, and market shifts as their greatest challenges. Yet when addressed with an open mindset, challenges create opportunities within the enterprise\u2014and visibility. Harvard Business Review article, Three steps to prepare your supply chain for the next crisis . reports: Companies that are well prepared and as a result prosper in a crisis can expect to recover more quickly than their competitors. In a review of corporate performance during the past four U.S. downturns (since 1985), Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that 14% of companies increased their sales and their profit margin. Investors are starting to reward companies that build for the future by becoming more innovative and more resilient. In June 2020, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, BCG surveyed major institutional investors and found that nine out of ten believed it was \"important for healthy companies to prioritize the building of business capabilities \u2014 even if it means lowering earnings-per-share guidance or delivering below consensus.\" The McKinsey report How COVID-19 is reshaping supply chains explains that companies found it was easier to increase inventories than implement their preferred strategy of nearshoring or regionalization. In addition, \"The proactive monitoring of supplier risks was the primary focus \u2026, yet significant blind spots remain in most companies\u2019 supply-chain risk-management setups. Just under half of the companies in our survey say they understand the location of their tier-one suppliers and the key risks those suppliers face.\" Enhanced customer experiences, improved profitability, and more predictive forecasts are high on CSCOs' priority lists according to a report by IBM Institute for Business Value, Own your transformation: Data-led innovation for the modern supply chain .","title":"Business challenges"},{"location":"sustainability/inventory/#business-value","text":"Inventory optimisation is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory across the enterprise.
