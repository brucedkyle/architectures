We will start by defining the business problem and the two main use cases: understock and overstock, describe the challenges and business drivers organizations face. Next, we will provide an action guide, provide an overview of the solution, show a schematic of the two use cases, understock and overstock, and conclude with the technology used in the solution. For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see Inventory Optimization . Business problem Inventory optimization is a critical element of any retail organisation's fulfilment process. It represents a balancing act between two key viewpoints in the fulfilment process. The first viewpoint is demand . The business needs to understand their current demand for products, goods and services. There are two aspects of demand, the \u201ccurrent\u201d demand and the \u201cfuture\u201d demand. Current demand asks the question, \u201chow many unsatisfied orders or requests do we have in the system at this point in time?\u201d Future demand asks the more difficult question, \u201chow many orders or requests do we expect to have at some point in the future?\u201d This future point could be measured in minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and even years. The further into the future, the harder it becomes to predict the demand. The second viewpoint is inventory . The business needs to have a clear understanding of all the inventory held within their fulfilment system. An inventory management provides oversight of current inventory and inventory changes due to purchases. Performs analysis on sold products, keeps consolidated stock data, and handles stock allocation. Makes decision on reallocation of goods between multiple warehouses. Inventory is stock or inventory available for sale to customers. As with demand, inventory has two aspects, \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d inventory. Current inventory asks two questions, \u201chow many items of a particular product do I have available at this point in time?\u201d and \u201cwhere are those items located?\u201d Future inventory asks the question, \u201chow much inventory is required at some point in the future\u201d. As with demand, this future point could range from minutes to years and becomes increasingly harder to predict the further into the future. Inventory optimization is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory. Getting the balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business. Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and in the worst case, eventual collapse of the business. To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimization for any retail business, this document will focus on main use cases of demand and inventory. Use cases Two main issues are represented by demand risk. Understock refers to not holding sufficient inventory to meet current demand. This includes not having enough inventory today but also, not having enough inventory in the very near future that could be used to meet the demand. The end result is disappointed customers who order but don\u2019t get fulfillment or can\u2019t order due to lack of product. This \u201cstock out\u201d position often represents between 4-8% of total sales lost, but can also be a failed opportunity to satisfy customer in other ways, through up-sell and cross-sell. KPIs that can help avoid an under stock or stock-out position. include inventory turn over rate, days on hand and lead time (how long it takes to get more inventory from a supplier). Overstock refers to holding more stock than required to meet current and future demand. This results in additional costs to store then dispose of overstocked items via discounts, selling at a loss or destruction. Whilst understock is measured in customer satisfaction and loss of future opportunity, overstock has direct impact on the bottom-line costs and profitability of the business. KPIS relevant to overstock include, holding costs, dead stock (in-stock items failing to sell) and inventory turnover rates. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Maintaining inventory control of high value items to minimize loss and associated cost. When stores receive inventory from warehouse or direct from suppliers, how to manage direct ship is a real challenge for each store as it has to be managed at the store level. Forecasting inventory levels intelligently to meet customer demand. Efficiently handle overstocking and understocking events Drivers Inventory turnover - if improve by 2 or 3 times then will drive bigger profit Managing capacity - across the enterpriese and with suppliers Enhanced customer experience with inventory matching customer demnd Handling overstock and understock events Responses Business Problem Solution Unusual events, such as the global pandemic, war or other international incident, port issues, and waterway obstructions illustrate the need for enterprises to build resilient supply chains. Respond with intelligence, speed, and confidence to reduce the impact of disruptions, turning these events into opportunities to outperform and outcompete. Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. Monitor and manage network inventory availability and respond to disruptions such as out-of-stock and overstock with alerts and recommended actions. The lack of pertinent product information and poor data flow across partners lead to inefficient inventory management, waste, and lost sales. Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each location. Business outcomes Improve inventory demand and forecasting Automated processes updating inventory in closer to real time Efficient, consistent decision making of overstock and understock Solution overview This solution in the following diagram reflects steps in the Action Guide: Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation. Accelerate automation in extended workflows Amp up AI to make workflows smarter Include sustainability commitments in decision making Modernize for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram: Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red Hat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop. Inventory Optimization platform Understock The following diagram shows the schematic for the understock use case. Understock workflow steps: Inventory Analysis detects low stock levels and predicts inventory will become unavailable sooner than originally expected. Inventory Control Tower alerted to the understock position. Inventory Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions Inventory Control Tower collects future demand requirements from Demand Intelligence. Colleague alerted and asked to take remediation action. Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: Ordering more stock Adjusting stock positions within existing Supply Chain Managing inventory held at existing stores or by moving existing inventory Managing inventory held at existing warehouses or by moving existing inventory Overstock The following diagram shows the schematic for the overstock use case. Overstock workflow steps: Inventory Analysis detects high stock levels and predicts inventory will not be sold as quickly as expected. Inventory Control Tower alerted to the overstock position. Inventory Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions. Inventory Control Tower collects future demand requirements from Demand Intelligence. Colleague alerted and asked to take remediation action. Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: Product discounting and promotions. Adjust stock positions within stores by moving stock between stores or warehouses to accelerate sales in conjunction with promotions. Reduce future inventory requirements to slow down or stop replenishment. Offering stock to partners for liquidation, destruction, donation, sale via alternative channels or to food-waste partners.

Use case As weather events and climate change increasingly impact businesses, it becomes harder for leaders to assess how extreme weather events will impact your operations. In 2020, there were 22 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in the US alone and you can understand why modeling the risk from weather is so critical to your operations. Background Business need to anticipate and respond to supply chain challenges due to unanticipated disasters. According to the Business Continuity Institute , 72% of suppliers who dealt with a breakdown in their supply chain lacked the full, real-time visibility needed to come up with a fast and simple solution. Business problem A central feature is time to recover (TTR), the time it would take for a particular node \u2014 a supplier facility, a distribution center, or a transportation hub \u2014 to be restored to full functionality after a disruption. The second concept is risk exposure, an assessment of exposure to risk based on a model that applies suppliers' TTR to estimate the performance impact, including operational (lost production) and financial (lost revenue and profit). Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Harvard Business Review article identified the following objectives for companies facing disaster situtations. Identify exposure to risk associated with parts and suppliers. Prioritize and allocate resources effectively. Invest in mitigation strategies such as booking logistics capacity. Drivers Monitor for disruptive environmental conditions such as severe weather, wildfires, flooding, air quality, and carbon emissions and send alerts when detected. Predict potential impacts of climate change and weather across the business using climate risk analytics. Reconfigure supply chain Some critical but vulnerable suppliers will go out of business. Reposition inventory in anticipation of certain regions or facilities facing disaster. Route deliveries around impacted areas . Responses Business Problem Solution Unusual events, such as the global pandemic, war or other international incident, port issues, and waterway obstructions illustrate the need for enterprises to build resilient supply chains.

The goal of last mile delivery logistics is to deliver the packages as affordably, quickly and accurately as possible. The last mile describes the difficulty of getting goods (especially large and bulky ones) from a transportation hub to their final destination because it might include installation and configuration while providing an excellent experience at the same time. Intelligent order is a process that uses inventory management systems and AI to provide effective last mile delivery. For businesses this means: Decrease waste Order optimization Reduced cost Consumers benefit with: Delivery promises fulfilled Proof of delivery Business problem If the last mile promise to delivery is incorrect and a product arrives late, there\u2019s a good chance that the customer will shop with a competitor next time. If last mile tracking information is incorrect, a product arrives late, is damaged, or is never delivered, there\u2019s a good chance that the customer will shop with a competitor next time. Customers want: Fast delivery Delivery tracking Security Convenience Specialization Selection delivery based on cost Business need to consider: Fuel costs Idling and downtime Warehousing Failed deliveries Returns Sustainability commitments Key metrics: 47.6% of shoppers will shop elsewhere if they cannot see inventory availability before they buy 49% of shoppers would cancel their cart due to mismatch between expectations for delivery date and actual delivery date 58% of shoppers report checking inventory availability in the last 6 months Deloitte describes key sector trends in Last mile delivery landscape in the grocery sector : Shifting tactics \u2013 evolving channel strategies and business models Need convenience delivered \u2013 customer\u2019s new mantra Future of Last Mile increasingly a story of better software and connectivity Use cases Business scenario Challenge Consumers are purchasing more products online Online purchases of goods and direct to consumer deliveries are increasing dramatically. This has driven huge increases in the volume and importance of last mile delivery and installation services. Consumers are placing more emphasis on after sales services Consumers are demanding more control over delivery times and processes and want more value-added services. Manufacturers and suppliers are not meeting expectations, especially with last mile services. New service providers are entering the market; reshaping the landscape New entrants to 3PL (third party logistics) services such as Amazon and Uber are disrupting traditional service models. Same day delivery is now an expectation, and this increases infrastructure and transportation services cost. Improved supply and demand forecasting is key to delivering last mile services. Logistics costs are increasing, while product prices are eroding Manufacturers are forced to react quickly to changing client demands while managing rising costs. Costs for warehousing, transportation and labor are increasing and this increases pressure on perfect order performance for both profitability and client loyalty. Proof of Delivery Proof of delivery, or POD, is an acknowledgment that an order successfully arrived at its intended destination and is used to show a service was completed, which is why proof of delivery is also called proof of completion. Proof of delivery comes in two forms: paper and electronic. Benefits of POD are captured in the table. Benefits for customers Benefits for businesses Customers in control Promise of delivery provides a better customer experience Proof of Delivery makes it less likely orders will be stolen Improves order accuracy and saves money on unnecessary refunds or replacements Lets customers know their service is complete POD automation accelerates back-office operations Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Consumer demand for delivery as promised Consumers wanting control of delivery and return processes Logistics costs in providing last mile delivery Logistics ecosystem complexity Drivers Increasing deliveries direct to consumer Need for delivery price-point optimization and improvement Customer satisfaction to drive repeat business Responses By definition, last mile delivery is relevant for businesses that deliver products directly to their consumers. Business Problem Solution Maximize inventory productivity Use real-time inventory visibility to confidently expose inventory and maximize conversions, gaining granular control over inventory actions, such as safety stock setting based on configurable business rules. Improve inventory turns by applying additional context like channel, fulfillment type and labor availability when making available-to promise decisions. Make and manage order promises Improve conversion rates by confidently delivering order and delivery promises across every step of the shopping journey, including the product list page, product detail page, cart, and checkout. Automate the review of inventory, capacity and costs to make informed promises, and harness powerful AI during fulfillment to simplify complex scenarios like orders with third-party services, and support a wide range of fulfillment options. Optimize omnichannel profitability Set operating performance objectives and KPIs using real cost drivers (like distance, labor, capacity, and carrier costs) and profit drivers markdown, stockout), so you can confidently make the best fulfillment decisions for your business objectives. By optimizing across thousands of fulfillment permutations in milliseconds, retailers can ensure balance between profitability and the best customer experience. Business outcomes Decrease waste . Decrease order fragmentation and waste with decrease in packages per order. Order optimization . In-stock improvement through holiday season using Order Optimizer. Reduce costs .

If the situation or problem is rectified withing a well defined time window, there is a possibility of salvaging the product. In some cases once the incident occurs, there is no possibility of salvage and the product is considered damaged. Typically these events are external factors forced upon the business and cannot always be planned or predicted. To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimization for any business, we will focus on two main use cases of an unanticipated exception: Environment Exceptions such as power outages or temperature changes that creates potential spoilage Product contamination or recall such as foreign objects or bacteria occuring earlier in the processing or supply chain We will start by defining the business problem and the two main use cases: Environmental Exceptions and Product contamination or recall, describe the challenges and business drivers organizations face. Next, we will provide an action guide, provide an overview of the solution, show a schematic of the two use cases: Environmental Exceptions and Product contamination or recall, and conclude with the technology used in the solution. For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see Inventory Optimization . Business problem Loss and waste management is principally focused on ensuring food and food related products remain fit for consumption at the time they are sold to the end consumer. However, external factors outside the control of the business can cause food items to be marked as spoiled or damaged. The problem faced by the business is ensuring the overall loss and wastage is minimised. To prevent spoilage, food products must typically be stored and transported at temperatures within well defined ranges. For example: - Frozen food must be kept below a specific temperature (0\u00b0F) at all times. If the temperature rises and food defrosts, it cannot be refrozen. - Chilled food must be kept within a temperature range (34\u00b0F - 39\u00b0F). The temperature can sometimes go above the higher limit for a short space of time before returning to the correct temperature, without becoming spoiled. If the high temperature is exceeded for a specified duration it must be considered spoiled. - Shelf stable food does not require chilling, but needs to be stored withing a temperature range to ensure the product shelf life is maintained. A shelf stable food product's shelf life can be 6 weeks to 5 years, depending on the product. To keep food at the correct temperature, refrigeration and chilling during transport and storage are the primary options. Power outages will happen. The ability to deal with the situation within well defined time periods is critical to ensuring the loss and wastage is minimised. If the problem can be rectified quickly and easily, there is every chance the product can remain in perfect conditiona and be sold to a consumer. Failure to act quickly will result in spoilage and loss of the product. Between farm and end consumer, food products generally go through multiple stages which vary depending on the end product. For convenience foods, there can be several manufuacturing steps, for fresh produce packaging and transport are the main stages. At any stage in the process, there is a possibility of contamination through foreign objects or bacteria. Both of which can trigger a recall of the food products. With any kind of contamination, a fast and efficient recall process to prevent the products beng purchased by consumers is vital. All retailers handing and selling food products need processes to reduce food waste through external factors and ensure recall procedures in the event of contamination are fast, efficient and minimise any risk to public health. Use cases The main use cases represented by loss management are: Environmental Exceptions \u2010 an environmental issue or problem places the food product at risk. If the issue is not dealt with quickly and efficiently the product will be spoiled making unavailable for sale to a consumer. Typically this would be a failure of refrigeration equipment or a loss of power to refrigeration euipment. If the temperature can be kept within a specific range, the product will remain suitable for sale to a consumer. If the temperature moves beyond the specified range for a set period of time, the product will be considered spoiled and no longer suitable for sale to a consumer. Product contamination or recall \u2010 a contamination or recall requires the food product to be removed immediately from the inventory and supply chain. The contamination issue or recall notice can come from external parties such as suppliers or food standards agencies, or through the retailer identifying an issue. Once the issue has been identified, the reatiler must immediately remove all affected products from their own inventory and supply chain, then destroy or pass the product to a third party. The issue can be caused by foreign objects or the detection of selected bateria in the product. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Protect public health: Businesses that sell consumable products are expected to protect the public health by implementing specific processes to address food safety. Maintaining equipment that refrigerates or freezes food or pharmaceutical products for storage until purchase or combined into a recipe and responding to and documenting actions taken to a food safety recall notification by either the supplier or regulatory body are key challenges. Regulatory compliance: Business that sell consumable products are expected to comply with local, state, and federal regulatory requirements for food and pharmaceutical products. Automated documentation of compliance is preferred over manual, error-prone documentation. Drivers Industry leading inventory management system, incorporating sensors that can mitigate risks before they create an exposure. Integrating loss and waste management into the core supply chain applications, leveraging technical investments in modern infrastructures and edge devices. Protect Reputation Avoid Penalties and fines Responses All businesses that require a supply chain have unanticipated issues. Business problem Solution Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. Monitor and manage network inventory availability and anticipate actions due to unanticipated exception with alerts and recommended actions Business process for handling unexpected issues may not be consistent across the enterprise Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each location and provide transparency to inventory. Enable actionable inventory shifts across the enterprise Visibility into actions needed and alternatives to anticipate and respond to inventory in an unanticipated event.

Inventory management encompasses procedures and processes that directly or indirectly affect the bottom line \u2010 ordering, receiving, storing, tracking and accounting for all of the goods a business sells. It is a key element of supply chain management. In this scenario, you will explore the implications of a perfect and imperfect order in which inventory: Can meet customer expecation. May not have all items available. Business problem Inventory visibility . Multichannel order fulfillment operations typically have inventory spread across many places throughout the supply chain. Inventory visibility is knowing what inventory you have and where it\u2019s located. Businesses need an accurate view of inventory to guarantee fulfillment of customer orders, reduce shipment turnaround times, and minimize stockouts, oversells and markdowns. Orders may not match available inventory . Inventory may not be on hand or in a different location than expected. Multiple and partial shipments may be able to solve many customer requests. Business solution The goal of inventory management is to have the right products in the right place at the right time. This requires inventory visibility \u2014 knowing when to order, how much to order and where to store stock. The basic steps of inventory management include: Purchasing inventory . Ready-to-sell goods are purchased and delivered to the warehouse or directly to the point of sale. Storing inventory . Inventory is stored until needed. Goods or materials are transferred across your fulfillment network until ready for shipment. Profiting from inventory . The amount of product for sale is controlled. Finished goods are pulled to fulfill orders. Products are shipped to customers. Use cases More and more businesses are looking at having sustainable supply chains because customers are demanding it. Use case Problem statement Solution Stock on hand Inventory visibility What goods are in stock, how much do you have and where are the items? All that information is required to fill orders. An Inventory management system helps provide that information and more. Forecasting for fulfillment / Demand forecasting Forecasting Forecasting is predicting how much inventory you\u2019ll need on hand to meet upcoming demand. Goal of forecasting is to have just enough inventory on hand to cover predicted sales for a prescribed period of time. Optimal inventory Monitor Orders & Inventory By minimizing lost sales, misplaced stock and excess ordering, inventory management boosts your profits and can even reduce your taxes. Optimal inventory level is the ideal quantity of product that one should have in a fulfillment center(s) at any given time. By optimizing inventory levels, you reduce the risk of common inventory issues, from high storage costs to out-of-stock items. Warehouse location Inside the Warehouse refers to the specific spot, such as a shelf or a bin, where a product is located within the four walls of a warehouse. It impacts the efficiency and timeliness of picking products. The products most often picked is placed in the most efficient spot. As products change and demand for products changes, the inventory layout can be updated to ensure continued efficiency. Warehouse location Physical Location of the Warehouse Choosing the site for a warehouse is based on many factors: Rent Rates & Taxes Workforce Availability, Labor Skills & Costs Access Roads, Highways & Traffic Flow Proximity to Airport, Railway Stations & Ports Proximity to Markets & Local Environment Building Availability & Utility Costs Building intelligent Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Inventory visibility . Multichannel order fulfillment operations typically have inventory spread across many places throughout the supply chain. Inventory visibility is knowing what inventory you have and where it\u2019s located. Businesses need an accurate view of inventory to guarantee fulfillment of customer orders, reduce shipment turnaround times, and minimize stockouts, oversells and markdowns. Orders may not match available inventory . Inventory may not be on hand or in a different location than expected. Multiple and partial shipments may be able to solve many customer needs. Spreadsheets, hand-counted stock levels and manual order placement have largely been replaced by advanced inventory tracking software. An inventory management system can simplify the process of ordering, storing and using inventory by automating end-to-end production, business management, demand forecasting and accounting. Drivers Supply chain operators will use technologies that provide significant insights into how supply chain performance can be improved. They\u2019ll anticipate anomalies in logistics costs and performance before they occur and have insights into where automation can deliver significant scale advantages Eliminate \u201cout of stock\u201d occurrences Optimizes inventory costs by balancing inventory to operational demand Improve stock allocation to improve space utilization Reduce dormant/non-moving inventory Have an accurate assessment of critical spares and the money invested in those parts Deliver transparency and visibility to critical and non-critical spares inventory for the organization Reduce time spent looking for and ordering parts Accelerate disposal of obsolete materials Business outcomes Decrease waste .

Perfect order The following diagram shows the inventory management scenario for an perfect order with responses for cases where the order is not perfect. Customer places/track/confirm order thru omni channel Inventory fulfilment, and delivery tracking information is quicky obtained from supply assurance Platform Access underlying backend system via API Management Notify various backend systems via the Integration Services Check with the Inventory Management System if inventory is available then lock the items and update the inventory. Use Store Operations System to determine if store can fulfill order. Store can only fulfill partial order. Notify customer about partial order fill. If acceptable, package order and get it ready for delivery to customer. Go to Step 7. If partial order is not acceptable, get it ready to be sent to warehouse. Go to Step 8. Notify Transport/Logistics System to schedule delivery. Use Warehouse Management System to find which warehouse can fulfill remaining order items. Send alert to warehouse to combine partial orders and package itmes and get it ready for delivery. Notify customer and update/sync related systems. Update Transport/Logistics System to schedule delivery. Cross check with the Fulfilment System to schedule and track the order and notify customer. Provide real-time tracking of the order to customer and upon delivery provide POD (electronic or paper) to customer. Action guide From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain: Automation Sustainability Modernization Actionable Step Implementation details Automation Monitor the criticality of inventory items to the organization Some are critical to operations or employee safety. Others are \u201cnice to have\u201d but not urgent. Select a methodology and a solution that routinely audit those parameters. For example, any time a new transaction is created in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), the solution needs to apply that transaction against the material to determine if the criticality is still correct. Automation Accelerate automation in extended workflows Automate the response using workflows that are consistant with criticality of the inventory items. Automation Provide visibility into the inventory system When users are inspecting inventory items, users can see where they have available inventory and receive recommendations about how much inventory can and should be transferred to the OOS / AOOS locations. These recommendations are based on adding automation and AI to make workflows smarter. Automation Automate the maintenance of scores to each individual item Eliminate data manual entry for criticality with a systems wide approach.

Use case Problem statement Solution Stock on hand Inventory visibility What goods are in stock, how much do you have and where are the items? All that information is required to fill orders. An Inventory management system helps provide that information and more. Forecasting for fulfillment / Demand forecasting Forecasting Forecasting is predicting how much inventory you\u2019ll need on hand to meet upcoming demand. Goal of forecasting is to have just enough inventory on hand to cover predicted sales for a prescribed period of time. Optimal inventory Monitor Orders & Inventory By minimizing lost sales, misplaced stock and excess ordering, inventory management boosts your profits and can even reduce your taxes. Optimal inventory level is the ideal quantity of product that one should have in a fulfillment center(s) at any given time. By optimizing inventory levels, you reduce the risk of common inventory issues, from high storage costs to out-of-stock items. Warehouse location Inside the Warehouse refers to the specific spot, such as a shelf or a bin, where a product is located within the four walls of a warehouse. It impacts the efficiency and timeliness of picking products. The products most often picked is placed in the most efficient spot. As products change and demand for products changes, the inventory layout can be updated to ensure continued efficiency.

This includes the realm of returns. Use cases Manage return policies and manage customer expectations. Minimizing return losses. Categorize return items for recycle, dispose, or return for sales. Determine fraudulent returns. Background Let\u2019s look at some of the trends that 2020 has seen so far: Extended return windows: Many retailers have instituted extended return periods that go beyond the average 30-day window for customers. Increased returns: With physical stores closed, ecommerce is on the rise. But with this shift comes increased returns, as customers can\u2019t be certain what they\u2019re buying online will be what the right size and fit. Not accepting returns: In the face of health concerns around coronavirus lingering on surfaces for extended periods of time, some retailers have stopped accepting product returns at all. Business problem Meet consumer demands by modernizing IT for the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Making returns easy for consumers is a way to create a loyal customer. Minimizing returns losses by: Sell the right item. One major step that eliminates a possible return is to make sure you sell the right item to the right customer. Save the sale. The \u2018save the sale\u2019 method is key for businesses who are looking to compensate for returns through a loyalty incentive. Smart returns. Smart returns will require a connected network of inventory visibility, as well as predicted demand. Predict returns. Data plays a vital role when it comes to predicting returns. Specifically, data that tracks the reason for a return: whether it's done directly (item was damaged, didn\u2019t fit, wasn\u2019t as pictured, etc.) or learned through predictive analytics. Buy online, pick up (or return) in-store. Retailers can give shoppers greater flexibility by allowing them to purchase online and then pick up in-store. While they\u2019re there to pick up, they can test or try products they\u2019ve ordered and make an exchange via curbside processing if needed. Virtual or personal shopping. Whether it\u2019s a virtual showcase of new items for your most loyal customers, or enabling sales associates to set aside items for shoppers based on their past purchase history, these tech-enabled shopping solutions should help lower the risk of returns. Process returns quickly and efficiently, reducing the amount of time and employee hours spent. Identify fraudulent returns : Returning stolen merchandise Receipt fraud Employee fraud Price switching Price arbitrage Switch fraud Bricking Cross-retail return Open-box fraud Wardrobing Drivers Increase customer loyalty with appropriate returns policies Minimizing returns losses The return process is an opportunity to upsell Identify fraudulent returns Provide sustainable transport of returned items Responses Business Problem Solution Unusual events, such as the global pandemic, war or other international incident, port issues, and waterway obstructions illustrate the need for enterprises to build resilient supply chains. Respond with intelligence, speed, and confidence to reduce the impact of disruptions, turning these events into opportunities to outperform and outcompete. Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand.

These sourcing decisions can dramatically increase profits, especially during peak periods. In addition, organizations are exploring how to provide a more sustainable footprint. Organizations are looking to redefine an enterprise-wide approach to sustainability. In this overview, we will discuss the business challenges, business value, and business outcomes and then provide automation and modernization actionable steps organizations can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain. These are based on The Action Guide in Own your transformation survey of 1500 CSCOs across 24 industries. Actionable steps will be developed through the lens of use cases on how the main risk factors can be transformed: To further describe the business problems and possible solutions a number of scenarios will be introduced. - Perfect order - Intellient Order - Demand risk - Loss and waste management - Product timeliness - Sustainable supply chain We will then give an overview of the solution, reference architecture, logical diagram, and how these capabilities are realized by technology capabilities. Supply chain concepts Fulfilment is the process of exceeding customer expectations when the customer receives their requested products, good or services. The items must be made available in a suitable timeframe, at the correct location and in an acceptable condition. Fulfilment optimization takes the fulfillment process a step further by using information and knowledge about the supply chain, inventory and stock positions to ensure any promises made to the customer are met or exceeded. A key element of the retail fulfilment process is knowing the inventory position. This is the amount of stock available for sale to a customer, it\u2019s location and the time it takes to make it available to the customer. Inventory optimization is a collection of best practices for ensuring the retail organisation maintains complete and accurate stock levels whilst balancing customer demand against current and future stock levels. Sustainability in business refers to a company's strategy to reduce negative environmental impact resulting from their operations in a particular market. An organization\u2019s sustainability practices are typically analyzed against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics. The business goal is to balance the long-term imperative to protect the planet with the immediate need to preserve the bottom line. Business problem Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCOs) face issues related to supply chain disruptions, technology infrastructure, sustainability, and market shifts as their greatest challenges. Yet when addressed with an open mindset, challenges create opportunities within the enterprise\u2014and visibility. Harvard Business Review article, Three steps to prepare your supply chain for the next crisis . reports: Companies that are well prepared and as a result prosper in a crisis can expect to recover more quickly than their competitors. In a review of corporate performance during the past four U.S. downturns (since 1985), Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that 14% of companies increased their sales and their profit margin. Investors are starting to reward companies that build for the future by becoming more innovative and more resilient. In June 2020, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, BCG surveyed major institutional investors and found that nine out of ten believed it was \"important for healthy companies to prioritize the building of business capabilities \u2014 even if it means lowering earnings-per-share guidance or delivering below consensus.\" The McKinsey report How COVID-19 is reshaping supply chains explains that companies found it was easier to increase inventories than implement their preferred strategy of nearshoring or regionalization. In addition, \"The proactive monitoring of supplier risks was the primary focus \u2026, yet significant blind spots remain in most companies\u2019 supply-chain risk-management setups. Just under half of the companies in our survey say they understand the location of their tier-one suppliers and the key risks those suppliers face.\" Enhanced customer experiences, improved profitability, and more predictive forecasts are high on CSCOs' priority lists according to a report by IBM Institute for Business Value, Own your transformation: Data-led innovation for the modern supply chain . Business value Inventory optimization is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory across the enterprise. Getting the balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business. Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and in the worst case, eventual collapse of the business. Specifically, Harvard Business Review article recommends: CEOs need to invest in risk intelligence and strategic foresight, creating a team of procurement super-forecasters equipped with the latest artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered sensing technology. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Addressing supply chain disruptions, technology infrastructure, sustainability and market shifts. Using an open mindset to address challenges thereby create opportunities. Drivers Resilient inventory management systems handle unexpected events and disruption to ensure business success Right product at the right time, matching customer expectations Enhanced customer experience with inventory matching customer demand Increased margins and improved net zero benefits due to reduce food waste and spoilage Perfect product delivery delighting customers Business outcomes Business responds to unexpected changes in supply chain Increased customer satisfaction by meeting customer expectation for goods and delivery Profit, revenue increases due to reduce waste and spoilage Meets sustainability commitments reflected in brand awareness Impacts on KPIs According to the IBM IBV study , innovators track well ahead of their peers when it comes to AI-enabled workflows for risk management and to handle other predictions. And they expect continued development of these workflows and other capabilities over the next three years. Right now, Innovator CSCOs report developing digitized workflows and leveraging AI automation a full 95% more than their peers. Innovators also stand out by leveraging data with AI and advanced analytics in demand management. With demand volatility and associated supplier, operations, and logistics disruption at all-time highs, CSCOs are applying AI and machine learning to the critical and strategic continuous planning elements of demand management and forecasting. A full 90% of Innovators use AI and advanced analytics in demand management and predictive forecasting, 18% more than their peers (76%). Directly influence the following KPIs: Improve lost sales from stock out 4-8% Solution cost savings 10% Increase stock turnover Reduce days on hand Manage lead time (may be leading indicator of stock overage) Reduce holding cost Manage product at risk/perishability/age Improve gross margin return on investment Reduce return rate Black swan events. Manage unusual events regarding weather, natural disaster, supply chain interruption. Improve customer satisfaction Solution overview This solution combines existing systems with state-of-the-art offerings to: Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation. Accelerate automation in extended workflows Amp up AI to make workflows smarter Modernize for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms The following diagram provides a high-level overview how systems work together for the desired outcomes. Scenarios To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimization for any business, several articles outline main use cases on how the main risk factors can be transformed: Perfect order Intellient Order Demand risk Loss and waste management Product timeliness Sustainable supply chain The following section explore more details on each of the scenarios. Perfect order Inventory may not be on hand or in a different location than expected. Multiple and partial shipments may be able to solve many customer requests. The business can respond to the imperfect order and increase customer responsiveness with: Intelligent promising Optmization user expectations with improved demand forecasting Automated responses For more information and solution details on this scenario, see Perfect order Intelligent order If the last mile delivery promise is incorrect and a product arrives late, there\u2019s a good chance that the customer will shop with a competitor next time. If last mile tracking information is incorrect, a product arrives late, is damaged, or is never delivered, there\u2019s a good chance that the customer will shop with a competitor next time. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Intelligent order . Demand risk Understock - not holding sufficient inventory to meet current demand. This includes not having enough inventory today but also, not having enough inventory in the very near future that could be used to meet the demand. Overstock - holding more stock than required to meet current and future demand. This results in additional costs to store then dispose of overstocked items via discounts, selling at a loss or destruction. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Demand risk . Loss and waste management Loss and waste management requires you to take decisive action in cases of: Shelf life . Identify and timely replace items as shelf life expires. NOTE: This is covered in Product timeliness Environmental exceptions . Food expirations, power interruption or other disaster affecting the product salability. Contamination or recall . Quickly identify, remove contaminated and recalled items from sale or items that have a contaminated component. Proactively provide safe alternative or replacement when safe. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Loss and waste management . Product timeliness Product timeliness is having goods and products in the right place at the right time, packed correctly and in line with customer expectations. This risk is particular to seasonal goods, fast fashion, drugs, cosmetics, grocery and food supply industry. KPIs relevant to product timeliness include dead stock and inventory days on hand. Shelf life defines a set of actions to be taken with products that expire on specific dates and must be removed from use or sale. For example, food can expire and need to be removed from shelves. Timeliness defines a set of actions that can be taken when products expire, but that may be still have some benefit. For example, seasonality of clothing can be warehoused until the following year. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Product timeliness . Sustainable supply chain Sustainability provides an opportunity to differentiate your business, yet the business must balance the long-term imperative to protect the planet with the immediate need to preserve the bottom line. On a rapidly warming planet, companies across sectors have transformed business models to forge a sustainable future \u2010 one that protects people, planet, and profits. In the race to reduce emissions, consumption, and waste, everything is on the table. Supply chains are being recalibrated. Source materials are evolving. Travel requests are carefully scrutinized.

Real estate plays a critical role in meeting these targets. More than 80% of CEOs expect sustainability investments to produce improved business results in the next five years. The key to a successful sustainability strategy is balancing the environmental drivers with market demands. Real estate is typically one of the largest expenses for an organization. Now an organization can make the most out of every square inch and meter of space. The World Economic Forum explains, energy consumption in the built environment accounted for 40% of global energy use and 33% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2019. In Europe alone, more than 220 million existing buildings \u2013 or 75% of the building stock \u2013 are energy-inefficient, with many relying on fossil fuels for heating and cooling. They continue: The more innovative, more efficient and cheaper way is to equip buildings with the digital tools that allow them to automatically adjust heating, lighting and other systems to the number of people present at any given time, using real-time data analysis. Use cases Manage competing needs with constrained resources. Improve an organization\u2019s capital project management capabilities. Manage buildings to encourage sustainability through the real estate lifecycle. Specifically: Include sustainability criteria in space acquisition and disposals (ISO 14000 as an example) Prioritize sustainability in construction and renovation projects Enable energy efficiency with green leases Reduce waste by integrating portfolio data Reach carbon footprint goals with space optimization Extend asset life through improved maintenance and assessment Maintain compliance to regulations and manage remediation with integrated Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS/HSE) processes. Minimize the environmental impact of your operations. Minimize/combine facility management work orders. Use data from sensors, such as HVAC, refrigerator and freezer temperatures. Identify and manage energy usage. Background Roughly 40% of the global share of annual carbon dioxide emissions comes from buildings. The UN Environment Program states that if nothing is done, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from buildings will more than double in the next 20 years. To meet targets for green house gas (GHG) emissions, buildings and cities must shift from being part of the problem to being part of the solution. Business problem There is a constant tension between using every square inch of space, reducing real estate operating costs, and creating outstanding occupant experiences. IDC in its Worldwide Integrated Workplace Management System 2020\u20132021 Vendor Assessment reports: Now organizations must prioritize creating safe and productive environments for their employees, students, and customers. In the short term, organizations had to take measures such as allowing a dramatic shift to working remotely where possible, modifying floor plans for social distancing, reducing building capacity, implementing new schedules, and deploying novel technology. Real estate and facility professionals have turned to a variety of \"return-to-work solutions\" for space reservations, health attestation, contact tracing, proximity monitoring, wayfinding, cleaning, communications, and so on. Organizations have an unprecedented opportunity to capture and analyze their data and develop greater operational resiliency and effectiveness. These data insights give companies the tools needed to react quickly to change, care for their employees and occupants, and make strategic space and occupancy decisions. Sustainability promotes business, supports the needs of our customers, generates profitability, and contributes to a better world. This is how we see our transformative role. \u2014 Fausto Ribeiro, CEO of Banco do Brasi Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges There are several challenges to overcome in the pursuit of becoming a truly sustainable business: Customer readiness . While the mindset around sustainability is shifting, no business can afford to be left behind, and few can financially afford to be too far ahead of the appetite for sustainable offerings. Co-creating a sustainable future requires a deep understanding of your customers and having partners with the right relationships and ecosystems to bring them along on the journey. Cost . Implementing sustainable business practices typically requires higher upfront investments. In the short term, it will often be cheaper to stick with the status quo. Some organizations will need help building an investment case to show how immediate investment will result in more durable profitability over the long run. Systemic inertia . While sustainability is an important goal, it often isn\u2019t seen as more important than other key priorities that may provide benefits sooner. Many businesses plan in ten-year increments, so while a 2050 commitment is good, it often isn\u2019t enough to drive sufficient action in this decade, from a planning standpoint. It comes back to reframing risks as opportunities and building the case that acting on sustainability now is necessary to achieving future sustainability in business. Lack of tools, insights and expertise . Being unprepared to develop a corporate sustainability vision, strategy and framework is a monumental risk. Companies may lack the ability to implement sustainable solutions or even know where to start. Sustainability in business is evolving and so are the answers. Every business needs an ecosystem of innovation partners to help them reinvent the world and create a sustainable future. Drivers Sustainability is good for business . Reduce energy costs . Include ESG criteria in decision making . Prioritize environmental improvement projects . Improve an capital project management capabilities .

Some of the questions they ask: How can I ensure my products, vendors and partners along my supply chain are aligned with my sustainability goals? Is my supply chain transparent and traceable? How can I get a handle on my Scope 3 emissions? Businesses are seeking to balance the long-term imperative to protect the planet with the short-term need to preserve the bottom line. Examples of sustainability in business: Improving energy management efficiency using alternative power sources and carbon accounting Deploying infrastructure that reduces GHG emissions, preserves water resources and eliminates waste Operating dynamic and efficient supply chains to empower a circular economy, encourage reuse, design out waste, promote sustainable consumption and protect natural resources Enabling sustainable development by assessing risks and improving resiliency while adhering to external regulations and development goals In this article, we explore sustainable supply chains . Reduce waste, cost-to-serve and logistics-related emissions by optimizing fulfillment and delivery with trusted supply chain solutions that are powered by AI, backed by blockchain, and built on an open, hybrid-cloud platform. Challenges / Business drivers Challenges There are several challenges to overcome in the pursuit of becoming a truly sustainable business: Upfront costs to becoming a sustainable business Difficuly in measuring and demonstrating lowering green house gas (GHG) emissions Customers are willing to pay a premium for sustainable products Creating a lower emissions business affects all business processes and departments Business drivers Increase creation and use of sustainable products Identify and monitor energy and emissions savings opportunities to accelerate decarbonization Enhance customer experience with eco-friendly packaging Improve brand awareness by being known as a sustainable business Delight customers with green energy delivery fleet Responses Business Problem Solution Automating ESG Reporting Capture and manage over quantitative and qualitive data types to support your expanding sustainability reporting requirements to frameworks and reporting schemes Strategic goal set for sustainability Incorporate sustainability options into customer decison making Connect your strategy with day-to-day operations to embed sustainability into your business transformation Create a lower-emissions business Build intelligent asset management into operations Business outcomes Transparency across multiple systems and suppliers to meet sustainability goals Drive business to meet sustainability commitment improves brand awareness Provide customer choices to drive sustainability Solution overview This solution focuses on Automation and Modernization in our Action Guide as shown in the following diagram: The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram: Core application systems.

Manufactured parts and goods also experience decay and deterioration. Each of these may be measured. In the food industry, you may see different terms and date types on the packaging, the following are common practices and their meanings according to the USDA and FDA as explained in Expiring Products \u2013 Food & Ingredients by Michigan State University: Best if used by/before: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality Use by: on any food OTHER than infant formula, this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality. If \u201cused by\u201d is present on infant formula, it\u2019s an expiration date, and you should discard the infant formula after the use by date. Sell by: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality Freeze by: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food should be frozen to maintain the best quality Expiration or EXP: this is an expiration date and usually only found on infant formula and some baby foods Guaranteed fresh: this term is NOT an expiration date, rather it\u2019s the date where the food may be at its best quality Other products, particularly pharmaceuticals, must be used within specific time frames to be warantted or to be considered safe and effective. Manufactured parts may be warranteed for specific periods or number of uses. For example, manufactured parts must be replaced when outside of certain tolerances. Some products may still continue to be useful beyond their expiration date or use. Products such as seasonal goods may not have, or require an expiriation date. In these cases the product should ideally be sold at the most relevant time within the calendar year. Once the seasonal timeframe has passed, the goods can still be sold, but demand and price can reduce. For any goods remaining once the season and demand has passed, the retailer must decide whether to discount the goods, pass to a third-party or retain and attempt to sell in the next season. For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see Inventory Optimization . Business problem Product liability claims can wreck a business. Defects and liability risks affect product manufacturers, designers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. Physical or digital items that omit adequate warnings, injure a third party, or cause a wrongful death can lead to lawsuits for any party involved in the product. Use Cases How should a business track and respond to issues? Responding to Shelf life defines a set of actions to be taken with products that expire on specific dates and must be removed from use or sale. For example, food can expire and need to be removed from shelves. Relevance defines a set of actions that can be taken when products are no longer relevance, possibly due to seasonality, but that may be still have some benefit. For example, seasonality of clothing can be warehoused until the following year. In both shelf life and relevance, you will want to plan and to take proactive steps in anticipation of product expirations. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Protect public safety by automating tracking and remediating items for shelf life and relevance Mitigate risks through specific actions, such as product removal, replacement, work order tracking to demonstrate the product is handled with due care Drivers Improve Public safety through automated shelf life tracking and management Reduce product liability claims through automation and AI Demonstrate due diligence for safety Identify and manage stock with reducing relevance to reduce financial loss Responses Many goods offered in retail and supplier businesses expire. Business problem Solution Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. Monitor and manage network inventory availability and anticipate actions due to expiration of products with alerts and recommended actions. The lack of pertinent product information (remaining shelf life, ambient temperature, etc.) and poor data flow across partners lead to inefficient inventory management, wastage and lost sales. Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each location \u2013 e.g., by remaining shelf life, time-since-harvested. Maintain freshness by acting on alerts received when items are at risk. Visibility into actions needed and alternatives to anticipate and respond to inventory as items approach end of shelf life. Provide actionable tasks, work orders, visibility for workers and supply chain partners to remove end of life items. Proactively replace items in response to product timeliness. Business outcomes Proactively protect public safety Mitigate product liability claims Demonstrate due diligence for safety Reduce financial loss due to reduced relevance Solution overview This solution focuses on Automation and Modernization in our Action Guide as shown in the following diagram: Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation. Accelerate automation in extended workflows Amp up AI to make workflows smarter Modernize for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram: Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on RedHat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop. Inventory Optimization platform Solution Principles True end-to-end visibility . Remove data silos and create a unified view across supply chain data with a standard data platform. Personalized dashboards and insights provide a 360-degreee view of KPIs and significant events. Manage by exception . Detect, display, and prioritize work tasks in real time. This allows clients to sense and react to issues quickly while managing risks and disruptions in a supply chain proactively. Intelligent workflows . Actionable workflows can be customized to meet unique requirements and process steps required to automate actions within source transactional systems. Make informed decisions with a supply chain virtual assistant that provides responses to issues based on a client\u2019s supply chain data using natural language search. Shelf life The following diagram shows the schematic for the shelf life use case. Shelf life steps: Inventory Control Tower hueristics determines product inventory is near its \"Use by\" date Inspects current inventory Notifies the Inventory Controller to take action Creates replenishment order Engages partners (Charity, recycler) to remediate expired or near expired stock Relevance The following diagram shows the schematic for the relevance use case. Relevance steps: Demand Intelligence determines requirements for seasonal, product trends and time sensitive future inventory Demand Intelligence informs Control Tower of future inventory to meet seasonal and product trends Control Tower collects Inventory (3a) and Supply Chain Intelligence (3b) information to understand current position and ability to meet future demand Control Tower determines current and future Inventory does not match inventory timeliness requirements for business and automates changes to Inventory via Fulfilment Optimiztion For any non-automated changes, alerts Colleague to take remediation action Colleague runs \u201cwhat-if\u201d analysis in Control Tower to determine best course of actions using Inventory and Demand data Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: Adjust product orders Managing inventory held at existing stores or by moving existing inventory Select alternative products Use case and benefit Use Case The Problem The Solution The Benefits and Implications Automated processes Manual input and follow up Business automation provides a systematic way to notifications, documentation of notifications, and creation of work orders. Actions follow a consistent business process and can be easily updated as needs change Expiring products Expiring item situations lead to lost revenue and decreased brand / retailer loyalty. Control Tower monitors inventory levels at all locations in a client\u2019s network and creates items in the work queue when revenue is at risk. When drilling down on the item, users can see where they have available inventory and receive recommendations about how much inventory can and should be ordered for replacement based on demand. Action can be taken directly from the Control Tower user interface. Expiring product situations are efficiently managed and OOS are avoided with minimal human intervention. API Management Separation of systems, control and monitoring of access, providing consistent user authentication and security between platforms. API Manages the access and permissions required for data between systems. Improved security, monitoring of frequency of access between systems. Improved system maintainability. Action Guide From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain: Automation Sustainability Modernization Actionable Step Implementation details Automation Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation Integrate data from multiple systems to get enterprise-wide view of changes in inventory demand. Monitor and analyze near real-time data Automation Accelerate automation in extended workflows Provide actionable tasks, work orders, visibility for workers and supply chain partners to remove end of life items. Proactively replace items in response to product timeliness. Automation Amp up AI to make workflows smarter For expiring products, Control Tower monitors inventory levels at all locations in a client\u2019s network and creates items in the work queue when revenue is at risk. When drilling down on the item, users can see where they have available inventory and receive recommendations about how much inventory can and should be ordered for replacement based on demand. Sustainability Include sustainability commitments in decision making Decision making includes sustainability in handing items being removed from stock.

Responding to Shelf life defines a set of actions to be taken with products that expire on specific dates and must be removed from use or sale. For example, food can expire and need to be removed from shelves. Relevance defines a set of actions that can be taken when products are no longer relevance, possibly due to seasonality, but that may be still have some benefit. For example, seasonality of clothing can be warehoused until the following year. In both shelf life and relevance, you will want to plan and to take proactive steps in anticipation of product expirations.","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"supplychain/timeliness/#challenges-business-drivers","text":"Challenges Protect public safety by automating tracking and remediating items for shelf life and relevance Mitigate risks through specific actions, such as product removal, replacement, work order tracking to demonstrate the product is handled with due care Drivers Improve Public safety through automated shelf life tracking and management Reduce product liability claims through automation and AI Demonstrate due diligence for safety Identify and manage stock with reducing relevance to reduce financial loss","title":"Challenges / Business Drivers"},{"location":"supplychain/timeliness/#responses","text":"Many goods offered in retail and supplier businesses expire. Business problem Solution Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. Monitor and manage network inventory availability and anticipate actions due to expiration of products with alerts and recommended actions. The lack of pertinent product information (remaining shelf life, ambient temperature, etc.) and poor data flow across partners lead to inefficient inventory management, wastage and lost sales. Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each location \u2013 e.g., by remaining shelf life, time-since-harvested. Maintain freshness by acting on alerts received when items are at risk. Visibility into actions needed and alternatives to anticipate and respond to inventory as items approach end of shelf life.
