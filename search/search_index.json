We will start by defining the business problem and the two main use cases: understock and overstock, describe the challenges and business drivers organizations face. Next, we will provide an action guide, provide an overview of the solution, show a schematic of the two use cases: understock and overstock, and conclude with the technology used in the solution. For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see Inventory Optimisation . Business problem Inventory optimisation is a critical element of any retail organisation's fulfilment process. It represents a balancing act between two key viewpoints in the fulfilment process. The first viewpoint is demand . The business needs to understand their current demand for products, goods and services. There are two aspects of demand, the \u201ccurrent\u201d demand and the \u201cfuture\u201d demand. Current demand asks the question, \u201chow many unsatisfied orders or requests do we have in the system at this point in time?\u201d Future demand asks the more difficult question, \u201chow many orders or requests do we expect to have at some point in the future?\u201d This future point could be measured in minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and even years. The further into the future, the harder it becomes to predict the demand. The second viewpoint is inventory . The business needs to have a clear understanding of all the inventory held within their fulfilment system. An inventory management provides oversight of current inventory and inventory changes due to purchases. Performs analysis on sold products, keeps consolidated stock data, and handles stock allocation. Makes decision on reallocation of goods between multiple warehouses. Inventory is stock or inventory available for sale to customers. As with demand, inventory has two aspects, \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d inventory. Current inventory asks two questions, \u201chow many items of a particular product do I have available at this point in time?\u201d and \u201cwhere are those items located?\u201d Future inventory asks the question, \u201chow much inventory is required at some point in the future\u201d. As with demand, this future point could range from minutes to years and becomes increasingly harder to predict the further into the future. Inventory optimisation is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory. Getting the balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business. Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and in the worst case, eventual collapse of the business. To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimisation for any retail business, this document will focus on main use cases of demand and inventory. Use cases Two main issues are represented by demand risk. Understock - not holding sufficient inventory to meet current demand. This includes not having enough inventory today but also, not having enough inventory in the very near future that could be used to meet the demand. The end result is disappointed customers who order but don\u2019t get fulfillment or can\u2019t order due to lack of product. This \u201cstock out\u201d position often represents between 4-8% of total sales lost, but can also be a failed opportunity to satisfy customer in other ways, through up-sell and cross-sell. KPIs that can help avoid an under stock or stock-out position. include inventory turn over rate, days on hand and lead time (how long it takes to get more inventory from a supplier). Overstock - holding more stock than required to meet current and future demand. This results in additional costs to store then dispose of overstocked items via discounts, selling at a loss or destruction. Whilst understock is measured in customer satisfaction and loss of future opportunity, overstock has direct impact on the bottom-line costs and profitability of the business. KPIS relevant to overstock include, holding costs, dead stock (in-stock items failing to sell) and inventory turnover rates. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Stores receive inventory from warehouse or direct from suppliers. Managing direct ship is a real challenge for each store as it has to be managed at the store level. Maintaining inventory control of high value items to minimise loss and associated cost. Drivers Inventory turnover - if improve by 2 or 3 times then will drive bigger profit Managing capacity Initial costs - how much spending on warehouse and store to store-to-store inventory on shelf Responses Business Problem Solution Unusual events, such as the global pandemic, war or other international incident, port issues, and waterway obstructions illustrate the need for enterprises to build resilient supply chains. Respond with intelligence, speed, and confidence to reduce the impact of disruptions, turning these events into opportunities to outperform and outcompete. Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools, and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. Monitor and manage network inventory availability and respond to disruptions such as out-of-stock and overstock with alerts and recommended actions. The lack of pertinent product information and poor data flow across partners lead to inefficient inventory management, waste, and lost sales. Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each location.

Inventory Optimisation platform Understock The following diagram shows the schematic for the understock use case. Understock workflow steps: Inventory Analysis detects low stock levels and predicts inventory will become unavailable sooner than originally expected. Inventory Control Tower alerted to the understock position. Inventory Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions Inventory Control Tower collects future demand requirements from Demand Intelligence. Colleague alerted and asked to take remediation action. Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: Ordering more stock Adjusting stock positions within existing Supply Chain Managing inventory held at existing stores or by moving existing inventory Managing inventory held at existing warehouses or by moving existing inventory Overstock The following diagram shows the schematic for the overstock use case. Overstock workflow steps: Inventory Analysis detects high stock levels and predicts inventory will not be sold as quickly as expected. Inventory Control Tower alerted to the overstock position. Inventory Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions. Inventory Control Tower collects future demand requirements from Demand Intelligence. Colleague alerted and asked to take remediation action. Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: Product discounting and promotions. Adjust stock positions within stores by moving stock between stores or warehouses to accelerate sales in conjunction with promotions.

The items must be made available in a suitable timeframe, at the correct location and in an acceptable condition. Fulfilment optimisation takes the fulfillment process a step further by using information and knowledge about the supply chain, inventory and stock positions to ensure any promises made to the customer are met or exceeded. A key element of the retail fulfilment process is knowing the inventory position. This is the amount of stock available for sale to a customer, it\u2019s location and the time it takes to make it available to the customer. Inventory optimisation is a collection of best practices for ensuring the retail organisation maintains complete and accurate stock levels whilst balancing customer demand against current and future stock levels. In this overview, we will discuss the business challenges, business value, and business outcomes and then provide automation and modernization actionable steps organizations can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain. These are based on The Action Guide in Own your transformation survey of 1500 CSCOs across 24 industries. These actionable steps will be developed through the lens of use cases on how the main risk factors can be transformed: - Demand Risk (under stock and over stock), - Loss and waste management, and - Product timeliness. We will then give an overview of the solution, reference architecture, logical diagram, and how these capabilities are realized by technology capabilities. Business challenges Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCOs) face issues related to supply chain disruptions, technology infrastructure, sustainability, and market shifts as their greatest challenges. Yet when addressed with an open mindset, challenges create opportunities within the enterprise\u2014and visibility. Harvard Business Review article, Three steps to prepare your supply chain for the next crisis . reports: Companies that are well prepared and as a result prosper in a crisis can expect to recover more quickly than their competitors. In a review of corporate performance during the past four U.S. downturns (since 1985), Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that 14% of companies increased their sales and their profit margin. Investors are starting to reward companies that build for the future by becoming more innovative and more resilient. In June 2020, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, BCG surveyed major institutional investors and found that nine out of ten believed it was \"important for healthy companies to prioritize the building of business capabilities \u2014 even if it means lowering earnings-per-share guidance or delivering below consensus.\" The McKinsey report How COVID-19 is reshaping supply chains explains that companies found it was easier to increase inventories than implement their preferred strategy of nearshoring or regionalization. In addition, \"The proactive monitoring of supplier risks was the primary focus \u2026, yet significant blind spots remain in most companies\u2019 supply-chain risk-management setups. Just under half of the companies in our survey say they understand the location of their tier-one suppliers and the key risks those suppliers face.\" Enhanced customer experiences, improved profitability, and more predictive forecasts are high on CSCOs' priority lists according to a report by IBM Institute for Business Value, Own your transformation: Data-led innovation for the modern supply chain . Business value Inventory optimisation is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory across the enterprise. Getting the balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business. Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and in the worst case, eventual collapse of the business. Business outcomes According to the IBM IBV study , innovators track well ahead of their peers when it comes to AI-enabled workflows for risk management and to handle other predictions. And they expect continued development of these workflows and other capabilities over the next three years. Right now, Innovator CSCOs report developing digitized workflows and leveraging AI automation a full 95% more than their peers. Innovators also stand out by leveraging data with AI and advanced analytics in demand management. With demand volatility and associated supplier, operations, and logistics disruption at all-time highs, CSCOs are applying AI and machine learning to the critical and strategic continuous planning elements of demand management and forecasting. A full 90% of Innovators use AI and advanced analytics in demand management and predictive forecasting, 18% more than their peers (76%). Directly influence the following KPIs: Improve lost sales from stock out 4-8% Solution cost savings 10% Increase stock turnover Reduce days on hand Manage lead time (may be leading indicator of stock overage) Reduce holding cost Manage product at risk/perishability/age Improve gross margin return on investment Reduce return rate Black swan events. Manage unusual events regarding weather, natural disaster, supply chain interruption. Improve customer satisfaction Action guide From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain. Automation Accelerate automation in extended workflows Amp up AI to make workflows smarter Cultivate collaborative ecosystems Sustainability Link environmental and social initiatives with business solutions Optimize workflows with AI to manage carbon, waste, energy, and water consumption Compete with new sustainable products and services Modernization Architect modern infrastructures Scale hybrid cloud platforms Increase awareness of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and solutions For specific steps on this approach, see The Action Guide in Own your transformation survey of 1500 CSCOs across 24 industries. Scenarios To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimisation for any business, several articles outline main use cases on how the main risk factors can be transformed: Demand risk Loss and waste management Product timeliness Demand Risk Understock - not holding sufficient inventory to meet current demand. This includes not having enough inventory today but also, not having enough inventory in the very near future that could be used to meet the demand. Overstock - holding more stock than required to meet current and future demand. This results in additional costs to store then dispose of overstocked items via discounts, selling at a loss or destruction. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Inventory Optimisation - Demand Risk . Inventory Risk - Loss and waste management Loss and waste management requires you to take decisive action in cases of: Shelf life . Identify and timely replace items as shelf life expires. NOTE: this is covered in Product timeliness Environmental exceptions . Food expirations, power interruption or other disaster affecting the product salability. Contamination or recall . Quickly identify, remove contaminated and recalled items from sale or items that have a contaminated component. Proactively provide safe alternative or replacement when safe. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Inventory Optimisation - Loss and waste management . Inventory Risk - Product timeliness Product timeliness is having goods and products in the right place at the right time, packed correctly and in line with customer expectations. This risk is particular to seasonal goods, fast fashion, drugs, cosmetics, grocery and food supply industry. KPIs relevant to product timeliness include dead stock and inventory days on hand. Shelf life defines a set of actions to be taken with products that expire on specific dates and must be removed from use or sale. For example, food can expire and need to be removed from shelves. Timeliness defines a set of actions that can be taken when products expire, but that may be still have some benefit. For example, seasonality of clothing can be warehoused until the following year. For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see Inventory Optimisation - Product timeliness .

They can also respond to automated actions based on business rules or from other layers in the system. Inventory Optimisation Platform Each of the core application systems provides data and responds to events through the foundational technologies. Inventory Control Tower . Gartner describes supply chain technology as a central hub as an integrated part of a broader SCM platform using these building blocks: people, process, data, organization and technology. The idea is to capture and use data to provide enhanced real-time visibility and in-depth analysis. IBM Supply Chain Control Tower , powered by industry-leading AI, provides actionable visibility to orchestrate your end-to-end supply chain network, identify and understand the impact of external events to predict disruptions, and take actions based on recommendations to mitigate the upstream and downstream effects. Fulfillment optimisation . Gartner describes the fulfillment forecasting approach , which provides a more accurate view of consumer fulfillment choices. This approach enables retailers to accurately gauge the right amount of inventory required to meet demand in stores, distribution centers and other inventory holding notes throughout the retailer\u2019s network. IBM offers IBM Sterling Intelligent Promising provides shoppers with greater certainty, choice and transparency across their buying journey. Inventory Analysis and AI . This cognitive analytic engine enhances existing order management systems. It determines the best location from which to fulfill an order, based on business rules, cost factors, and current inventory levels and placement. IBM includes IBM Sterling Fulfillment Optimizer with Watson as a component of IBM Sterling Intelligent Promising. Supply Risk Management . Gartner describes the key tenets of supply chain risk management enhance resilience and improve competitiveness. Market disruptions include: natural disasters, pandemics, political uncertainty, economic upheaval, cyber and terrorist attacks, third-party or supplier threats, and rapid swings in consumer preferences and demand. Supply chain transformation also complicates supply chain risk management lean, but complex and globally dispersed operations add risks, and the supply chain risk management process is vital in wringing out efficiencies and costs. Inventory visibility . This processes inventory supply and demand activity to provide accurate and real-time global visibility across selling channels. For this solution, IBM offers Sterling Inventory Visibility , which is included with IBM Sterling Intelligent Promising.

The items must be made available in a suitable timeframe, at the correct location and in an acceptable condition. Fulfilment optimisation takes the fulfillment process a step further by using information and knowledge about the supply chain, inventory and stock positions to ensure any promises made to the customer are met or exceeded. A key element of the retail fulfilment process is knowing the inventory position. This is the amount of stock available for sale to a customer, it\u2019s location and the time it takes to make it available to the customer. Inventory optimisation is a collection of best practices for ensuring the retail organisation maintains complete and accurate stock levels whilst balancing customer demand against current and future stock levels.

In a review of corporate performance during the past four U.S. downturns (since 1985), Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that 14% of companies increased their sales and their profit margin. Investors are starting to reward companies that build for the future by becoming more innovative and more resilient. In June 2020, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, BCG surveyed major institutional investors and found that nine out of ten believed it was \"important for healthy companies to prioritize the building of business capabilities \u2014 even if it means lowering earnings-per-share guidance or delivering below consensus.\" The McKinsey report How COVID-19 is reshaping supply chains explains that companies found it was easier to increase inventories than implement their preferred strategy of nearshoring or regionalization. In addition, \"The proactive monitoring of supplier risks was the primary focus \u2026, yet significant blind spots remain in most companies\u2019 supply-chain risk-management setups. Just under half of the companies in our survey say they understand the location of their tier-one suppliers and the key risks those suppliers face.\" Enhanced customer experiences, improved profitability, and more predictive forecasts are high on CSCOs' priority lists according to a report by IBM Institute for Business Value, Own your transformation: Data-led innovation for the modern supply chain .","title":"Business challenges"},{"location":"sustainability/inventory/#business-value","text":"Inventory optimisation is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory across the enterprise.

If the situation or problem is rectified withing a well defined time window, there is a possibility of salvaging the product. In some cases once the incident occurs, there is no possibility of salvage and the product is considered damaged. Typically these events are external factors forced upon the business and cannot always be planned or predicted. To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimisation for any business, we will focus on two main use cases of an unanticipated exception: Environment Exceptions such as power outages or temperature changes that creates potential spoilage Product contamination or recall such as foreign objects or bacteria occuring earlier in the processing or supply chain We will start by defining the business problem and the two main use cases: Environmental Exceptions and Product contamination or recall, describe the challenges and business drivers organizations face. Next, we will provide an action guide, provide an overview of the solution, show a schematic of the two use cases: Environmental Exceptions and Product contamination or recall, and conclude with the technology used in the solution. For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see Inventory Optimisation . Business problem Loss and waste management is principally focused on ensuring food and food related products remain fit for consumption at the time they are sold to the end consumer. However, external factors outside the control of the business can cause food items to be marked as spoiled or damaged. The problem faced by the business is ensuring the overall loss and wastage is minimised. To prevent spoilage, food products must typically be stored and transported at temperatures within well defined ranges. For example: - Frozen food must be kept below a specific temperature (0\u00b0F) at all times. If the temperature rises and food defrosts, it cannot be refrozen. - Chilled food must be kept within a temperature range (34\u00b0F - 39\u00b0F). The temperature can sometimes go above the higher limit for a short space of time before returning to the correct temperature, without becoming spoiled. If the high temperature is exceeded for a specified duration it must be considered spoiled. - Shelf stable food does not require chilling, but needs to be stored withing a temperature range to ensure the product shelf life is maintained. A shelf stable food product's shelf life can be 6 weeks to 5 years, depending on the product. To keep food at the correct temperature, refrigeration and chilling during transport and storage are the primary options. Power outages will happen. The ability to deal with the situation within well defined time periods is critical to ensuring the loss and wastage is minimised. If the problem can be rectified quickly and easily, there is every chance the product can remain in perfect conditiona and be sold to a consumer. Failure to act quickly will result in spoilage and loss of the product. Between farm and end consumer, food products generally go through multiple stages which vary depending on the end product. For convenience foods, there can be several manufuacturing steps, for fresh produce packaging and transport are the main stages. At any stage in the process, there is a possibility of contamination through foreign objects or bacteria. Both of which can trigger a recall of the food products. With any kind of contamination, a fast and efficient recall process to prevent the products beng purchased by consumers is vital. All retailers handing and selling food products need processes to reduce food waste through external factors and ensure recall procedures in the event of contamination are fast, efficient and minimise any risk to public health. Use cases The main use cases represented by loss management are: - Environmental Exceptions - an environmental issue or problem places the food product at risk. If the issue is not dealt with quickly and efficiently the product will be spoiled making unavailable for sale to a consumer. Typically this would be a failure of refrigeration equipment or a loss of power to refrigeration euipment. If the temperature can be kept within a specific range, the product will remain suitable for sale to a consumer. If the temperature moves beyond the specified range for a set period of time, the product will be considered spoiled and no longer suitable for sale to a consumer. - Product contamination or recall - a contamination or recall requires the food product to be removed immediately from the inventory and supply chain. The contamination issue or recall notice can come from external parties such as suppliers or food standards agencies, or through the retailer identifying an issue. Once the issue has been identified, the reatiler must immediately remove all affected products from their own inventory and supply chain, then destroy or pass the product to a third party. The issue can be caused by foreign objects or the detection of selected bateria in the product. Challenges / Business Drivers Challenges Protect public health: Businesses that sell consumable products are expected to protect the public health by implementing specific processes to address food safety. Maintaining equipment that refrigerates or freezes food or pharmaceutical products for storage until purchase or combined into a recipe and responding to and documenting actions taken to a food safety recall notification by either the supplier or regulatory body are key challenges. Regulatory compliance: Business that sell consumable products are expected to comply with local, state, and federal regulatory requirements for food and pharmaceutical products. Automated documentation of compliance is preferred over manual, error-prone documentation.

If the situation or problem is rectified withing a well defined time window, there is a possibility of salvaging the product. In some cases once the incident occurs, there is no possibility of salvage and the product is considered damaged. Typically these events are external factors forced upon the business and cannot always be planned or predicted. To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimisation for any business, we will focus on two main use cases of an unanticipated exception: Environment Exceptions such as power outages or temperature changes that creates potential spoilage Product contamination or recall such as foreign objects or bacteria occuring earlier in the processing or supply chain We will start by defining the business problem and the two main use cases: Environmental Exceptions and Product contamination or recall, describe the challenges and business drivers organizations face. Next, we will provide an action guide, provide an overview of the solution, show a schematic of the two use cases: Environmental Exceptions and Product contamination or recall, and conclude with the technology used in the solution.

However, external factors outside the control of the business can cause food items to be marked as spoiled or damaged. The problem faced by the business is ensuring the overall loss and wastage is minimised. To prevent spoilage, food products must typically be stored and transported at temperatures within well defined ranges. For example: - Frozen food must be kept below a specific temperature (0\u00b0F) at all times. If the temperature rises and food defrosts, it cannot be refrozen. - Chilled food must be kept within a temperature range (34\u00b0F - 39\u00b0F). The temperature can sometimes go above the higher limit for a short space of time before returning to the correct temperature, without becoming spoiled. If the high temperature is exceeded for a specified duration it must be considered spoiled. - Shelf stable food does not require chilling, but needs to be stored withing a temperature range to ensure the product shelf life is maintained. A shelf stable food product's shelf life can be 6 weeks to 5 years, depending on the product. To keep food at the correct temperature, refrigeration and chilling during transport and storage are the primary options. Power outages will happen. The ability to deal with the situation within well defined time periods is critical to ensuring the loss and wastage is minimised. If the problem can be rectified quickly and easily, there is every chance the product can remain in perfect conditiona and be sold to a consumer. Failure to act quickly will result in spoilage and loss of the product. Between farm and end consumer, food products generally go through multiple stages which vary depending on the end product. For convenience foods, there can be several manufuacturing steps, for fresh produce packaging and transport are the main stages. At any stage in the process, there is a possibility of contamination through foreign objects or bacteria. Both of which can trigger a recall of the food products. With any kind of contamination, a fast and efficient recall process to prevent the products beng purchased by consumers is vital.
