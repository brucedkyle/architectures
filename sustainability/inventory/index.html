    <h1 id="inventory-optimization-overview">Inventory Optimization Overview</h1>
<p><em>Fulfilment</em> is the process of exceeding customer expectations when the customer receives their requested products, good or services. The items must be made available in a suitable timeframe, at the correct location and in an acceptable condition.</p>
<p>Fulfilment optimisation takes the fulfillment process a step further by using information and knowledge about the supply chain, inventory and stock positions to ensure any promises made to the customer are met or exceeded.</p>
<p>A key element of the retail fulfilment process is knowing the inventory position. This is the amount of stock available for sale to a customer, it’s location and the time it takes to make it available to the customer. </p>
<p><em>Inventory optimisation</em> is a collection of best practices for ensuring the retail organisation maintains complete and accurate stock levels whilst balancing customer demand against current and future stock levels.</p>
<p>In this overview, we will discuss the business challenges, business value, and business outcomes and then provide automation and modernization actionable steps organizations can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain. These are based on The Action Guide in Own your transformation survey of 1500 CSCOs across 24 industries. 
These actionable steps will be developed through the lens of use cases on how the main risk factors can be transformed: 
-   Demand Risk (under stock and over stock), 
-   Loss and waste management, and 
-   Product timeliness. 
We will then give an overview of the solution, reference architecture, logical diagram, and how these capabilities are realized by technology capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="business-challenges">Business challenges</h2>
<p>Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCOs) face issues related to supply chain disruptions, technology infrastructure, sustainability, and market shifts as their greatest challenges. Yet when addressed with an open mindset, challenges create opportunities within the enterprise—and visibility. </p>
<p>Harvard Business Review article, <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/11/3-steps-to-prepare-your-supply-chain-for-the-next-crisis">Three steps to prepare your supply chain for the next crisis</a>. reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Companies that are well prepared and as a result prosper in a crisis can expect to recover more quickly than their competitors. In a review of corporate performance during the past four U.S. downturns (since 1985), Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that 14% of companies increased their sales and their profit margin.</p>
<p>Investors are starting to reward companies that build for the future by becoming more innovative and more resilient. In June 2020, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, BCG surveyed major institutional investors and found that nine out of ten believed it was "important for healthy companies to prioritize the building of business capabilities — even if it means lowering earnings-per-share guidance or delivering below consensus."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The McKinsey report <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/how-covid-19-is-reshaping-supply-chains">How COVID-19 is reshaping supply chains</a> explains that companies found it was easier to increase inventories than implement their preferred strategy of nearshoring or regionalization.  In addition, "The proactive monitoring of supplier risks was the primary focus …, yet significant blind spots remain in most companies’ supply-chain risk-management setups. Just under half of the companies in our survey say they understand the location of their tier-one suppliers and the key risks those suppliers face."</p>
<p>Enhanced customer experiences, improved profitability, and more predictive forecasts are high on CSCOs' priority lists according to a report by IBM Institute for Business Value, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/1BYY6VEM">Own your transformation: Data-led innovation for the modern supply chain</a>. </p>
<h2 id="business-value">Business value</h2>
<p>Inventory optimisation is making sure the current and future demand is accurately balanced against current and future inventory across the enterprise. Getting the balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business. Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and in the worst case, eventual collapse of the business.</p>
<h2 id="business-outcomes">Business outcomes</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/1BYY6VEM">According to the IBM IBV study</a>, innovators track well ahead of their peers when it comes to AI-enabled workflows for risk management and to handle other predictions. And they expect continued development of these workflows and other capabilities over the next three years. Right now, Innovator CSCOs report developing digitized workflows and leveraging AI automation a full 95% more than their peers.</p>
<p>Innovators also stand out by leveraging data with AI and advanced analytics in demand management. With demand volatility and associated supplier, operations, and logistics disruption at all-time highs, CSCOs are applying AI and machine learning to the critical and strategic continuous planning elements of demand management and forecasting. A full 90% of Innovators use AI and advanced analytics in demand management and predictive forecasting, 18% more than their peers (76%).</p>
<p>Directly influence the following KPIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve lost sales from stock out 4-8% </li>
<li>Solution cost savings 10% </li>
<li>Increase stock turnover</li>
<li>Reduce days on hand</li>

<h2 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h2>
<p>To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimisation for any business, several articles outline main use cases on how the main risk factors can be transformed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../demandrisk/">Demand risk</a></li>
<li><a href="../lossmanagement/">Loss and waste management</a></li>
<li><a href="../timeliness/">Product timeliness</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="demand-risk">Demand Risk</h3>
<p><em>Understock</em> - not holding sufficient inventory to meet current demand. This includes not having enough inventory today but also, not having enough inventory in the very near future that could be used to meet the demand.</p>
<p><em>Overstock</em> - holding more stock than required to meet current and future demand. This results in additional costs to store then dispose of overstocked items via discounts, selling at a loss or destruction. </p>
<p>For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see <a href="../demandrisk/">Inventory Optimisation - Demand Risk</a>.</p>
<h3 id="inventory-risk-loss-and-waste-management">Inventory Risk - Loss and waste management</h3>
<p><strong>Loss and waste management</strong> requires you to take decisive action in cases of:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Shelf life</em>. Identify and timely replace items as shelf life expires. <em>NOTE: this is covered in Product timeliness</em></li>
<li><em>Environmental exceptions</em>. Food expirations, power interruption or other disaster affecting the product salability.</li>
<li><em>Contamination or recall</em>. Quickly identify, remove contaminated and recalled items from sale or items that have a contaminated component. Proactively provide safe alternative or replacement when safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see <a href="../lossmanagement/">Inventory Optimisation - Loss and waste management</a>.</p>
<h3 id="inventory-risk-product-timeliness">Inventory Risk - Product timeliness</h3>
<p><strong>Product timeliness</strong> is having goods and products in the right place at the right time, packed correctly and in line with customer expectations. This risk is particular to seasonal goods, fast fashion, drugs, cosmetics, grocery and food supply industry. KPIs relevant to product timeliness include dead stock and inventory days on hand.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Shelf life</em> defines a set of actions to be taken with products that expire on specific dates and must be removed from use or sale. For example, food can expire and need to be removed from shelves. </li>
<li><em>Timeliness</em> defines a set of actions that can be taken when products expire, but that may be still have some benefit. For example, seasonality of clothing can be warehoused until the following year.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about the solution details on this scenario, see <a href="../timeliness/">Inventory Optimisation - Product timeliness</a>.</p>
