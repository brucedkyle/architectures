    <h1 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h1>
<p>Businesses are looking for sustainable supply chains. Some of the questions they ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I ensure my products, vendors and partners along my supply chain are aligned with my sustainability goals?</li>
<li>Is my supply chain transparent and traceable? </li>
<li>How can I get a handle on my Scope 3 emissions?</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses are seeking to balance the long-term imperative to protect the planet with the short-term need to preserve the bottom line. </p>
<p>Examples of sustainability in business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving energy management efficiency using alternative power sources and carbon accounting</li>
<li>Deploying infrastructure that reduces GHG emissions, preserves water resources and eliminates waste </li>
<li>Operating dynamic and efficient supply chains to empower a circular economy, encourage reuse, design out waste, promote sustainable consumption and protect natural resources</li>
<li>Enabling sustainable development by assessing risks and improving resiliency while adhering to external regulations and development goals</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, we explore <strong>sustainable supply chains</strong>. Reduce waste, cost-to-serve and logistics-related emissions by optimizing fulfillment and delivery with trusted supply chain solutions that are powered by AI, backed by blockchain, and built on an open, hybrid-cloud platform.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business drivers</h2>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are several challenges to overcome in the pursuit of becoming a truly sustainable business:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer readiness</strong>. While the mindset around sustainability is shifting, no business can afford to be left behind, and few can financially afford to be too far ahead of the appetite for sustainable offerings. Co-creating a sustainable future requires a deep understanding of your customers and having partners with the right relationships and ecosystems to bring them along on the journey.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>. Implementing sustainable business practices typically requires higher upfront investments. In the short term, it will often be cheaper to stick with the status quo. Some organizations will need help building an investment case to show how immediate investment will result in more durable profitability over the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Systemic inertia</strong>. While sustainability is an important goal, it often isn’t seen as more important than other key priorities that may provide benefits sooner. Many businesses plan in ten-year increments, so while a 2050 commitment is good, it often isn’t enough to drive sufficient action in this decade, from a planning standpoint. It comes back to reframing risks as opportunities and building the case that acting on sustainability now is necessary to achieving future sustainability in business.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of tools, insights and expertise</strong>. Being unprepared to develop a corporate sustainability vision, strategy and framework is a monumental risk. Companies may lack the ability to implement sustainable solutions or even know where to start. Sustainability in business is evolving and so are the answers. Every business needs an ecosystem of innovation partners to help them reinvent the world and create a sustainable future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business drivers</strong></p>
<p>Sustainability is good for business.</p>
<p>Many of the world’s top economies have or are developing, corporate disclosure requirements around environmental impact, driving businesses to curb GHG emissions.</p>
<p>55% of consumers say environmental responsibility is very or extremely important when choosing a brand. Being known as a sustainable business can improve your brand awareness and help you attract consumers that are favorably predisposed to companies actively engaged in sustainable practices.</p>
<p>The rise of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment criteria and sustainable investing means that a sustainable business is inherently more attractive to the rising numbers of responsible investors. Investment in ESG assets may reach $53 trillion by 2025, representing over a third of global assets.</p>
<p>In 2021, we also found that half of consumers said they were willing to pay a premium for a sustainable brand or sustainable products. And this year, 49% of consumers say they’ve paid a premium—an average of 59% more—for products branded as sustainable or socially responsible in the last 12 months.</p>

<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>This solution focuses on <em>Automation</em> and <em>Modernization</em> in our Action Guide as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p><img alt="solution overview" src="../media/sustainability.png" /></p>
<p>The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. </li>
<li>Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red Hat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop. </li>
<li>Inventory Optimization platform</li>
<li>Sustainability system acts as a key driver for automated product and transport selection, in addition to reporting and creating goal-driven outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sustainability_1">Sustainability</h2>
<p>The following diagram shows the schematic for the sustainability use case to improve your supply chain.</p>
<p><img alt="sustainability schematic" src="../media/sustainabilityschematic.svg" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Customer chooses items to buy online using the business app.
<li>Determine sustainability posture by determining ESG indicator values.
<li>Before providing cost and delivery options, provide customer sustainability options – equivalent greener items, later delivery day, pickup option, etc. If customer opts into sustainability option order is tagged so Supply Assurance Platform can honor that request.
<li>Inventory fulfilment system updates inventory data.
<li>Delivery Optimization system plays a key role in sustainability play. It determines whether to contact 3PL or if in-house Route Optimization can fulfill the requirements.
<li>If 3PL is the only option, contact the sustainability approved 3PL company to fulfill the order. 3PL company takes over the delivery flow from here. If business has the means to fulfill the order continue with next Step 6a.
<ul>
<li>Access underlying backend system via API Management
</ul>
<li>Alert the Order Fulfilment System (OFS) this special order via system APIs.
<li>OFS notifies the Warehouse Management System to package and get it ready for delivery.
<li>The Transport/Logistics System is alerted to schedule delivery. 
<ol>
<li>Track the order, notify customer and provide real-time tracking.
<li>Delivery department maintains the sustainability posture and upon final delivery provides POD (electronic or paper) to customer.
</ol>
<li>All sub-systems are updated via the data fabric that helps maintain a consistent view.
</ol>
