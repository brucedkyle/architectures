    <h1 id="inventory-management-last-mile-delivery">Inventory management - Last mile delivery</h1>
<p><em>Last mile delivery</em>, also known as <em>last mile logistics</em>, is the transportation of goods from a distribution hub to the final delivery destination — the door of the customer. The goal of last mile delivery logistics is to deliver the packages as affordably, quickly and accurately as possible. </p>
<p>The last mile describes the difficulty of getting goods (especially large and bulky ones) from a transportation hub to their final destination because it might include installation and configuration while providing an excellent experience at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="business-problem">Business problem</h2>
<p>If the last mile promise to delivery is incorrect and a product arrives late, there’s a good chance that the customer will shop with a competitor next time.</p>
<p>If last mile tracking information is incorrect, a product arrives late, is damaged, or is never delivered, there’s a good chance that the customer will shop with a competitor next time.</p>
<p>Customers want:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast delivery</li>
<li>Delivery tracking</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Convenience</li>
<li>Specialization</li>
<li>Selection delivery based on cost </li>
</ul>
<p>Business need to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuel costs</li>
<li>Idling and downtime</li>
<li>Warehousing</li>
<li>Failed deliveries</li>
<li>Returns</li>
</ul>
<p>Key metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>47.6% of shoppers will shop elsewhere if they cannot see inventory availability before they buy</li>
<li>49% of shoppers would cancel their cart due to mismatch between expectations for delivery date and actual delivery date</li>
<li>58% of shoppers report checking inventory availability in the last 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p>Deloitte describes key sector trends in <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/Industries/consumer/perspectives/last-mile-delivery.html">Last mile delivery landscape in the grocery sector</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shifting tactics – evolving channel strategies and business models</li>
<li>Need convenience delivered – customer’s new mantra</li>
<li>Future of Last Mile increasingly a story of better software and connectivity</li>

<th>Business scenario</th>
<th>Challenge</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Consumers are purchasing more products online</td>
<td>Online purchases of goods and direct to consumer deliveries are increasing dramatically.  This has driven huge increases in the volume  and importance of last mile delivery and installation services.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consumers are placing more emphasis on after sales services</td>
<td>Consumers are demanding more control over delivery times and processes and want more value-added services. Manufacturers and suppliers are not meeting expectations, especially with last mile services.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>New service providers are entering the market; reshaping the landscape</td>
<td>New entrants to 3PL (third party logistics) services such as Amazon and Uber are disrupting traditional service models.  Same day delivery is now an expectation, and this increases infrastructure and transportation services cost. Improved supply and demand forecasting is key to delivering last mile services.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Logistics costs are increasing, while product prices are eroding</td>
<td>Manufacturers are forced to react quickly to changing client demands while managing rising costs. Costs for warehousing, transportation and labor are increasing and this increases pressure on perfect order performance for both profitability and client loyalty.  </td>

<h3 id="proof-of-delivery">Proof of Delivery</h3>
<p>Proof of delivery, or POD, is an acknowledgment that an order successfully arrived at its intended destination and is used to show a service was completed, which is why proof of delivery is also called proof of completion. Proof of delivery comes in two forms: paper and electronic. Benefits of POD are captured in the table.</p>

<tr>
<td>Maximize inventory productivity</td>
<td>Use real-time inventory visibility to confidently expose inventory and maximize conversions, gaining granular control over inventory actions, such as safety stock setting based on configurable business rules. Improve inventory turns by applying additional context like channel, fulfillment type and labor availability when making available-to promise decisions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Make and manage order promises</td>
<td>Improve conversion rates by confidently delivering order and delivery promises across every step of the shopping journey, including the product list page, product detail page, cart, and checkout. Automate the review of inventory, capacity and costs to make informed promises, and harness powerful AI during fulfillment to simplify complex scenarios like orders with third-party services, and support a wide range of fulfillment options.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Optimize omnichannel profitability</td>
<td>Set operating performance objectives and KPIs using real cost drivers (like distance, labor, capacity, and carrier costs) and profit drivers markdown, stockout), so you can confidently make the best fulfillment decisions for your business objectives. By optimizing across thousands of fulfillment permutations in milliseconds, retailers can ensure balance between profitability and the best customer experience.</td>
