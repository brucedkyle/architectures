    <h1 id="disaster-readiness">Disaster readiness</h1>
<p>Companies are facing climate-related asset damage, supply chain and operations disruptions and increasing expectations from consumers and investors to perform as an environmental leader. </p>
<h2 id="use-case">Use case</h2>
<p>As weather events and climate change increasingly impact businesses, it becomes harder for leaders to assess how extreme weather events will impact your operations. </p>
<p>In 2020, there were <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2020-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters-historical">22 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters</a> in the US alone and you can understand why modeling the risk from weather is so critical to your operations. </p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Business need to anticipate and respond to supply chain challenges due to unanticipated disasters.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.thebci.org/">Business Continuity Institute</a>, 72% of suppliers who dealt with a breakdown in their supply chain lacked the full, real-time visibility needed to come up with a fast and simple solution.</p>
<h2 id="business-problem">Business problem</h2>
<p>A central feature is time to recover (TTR), the time it would take for a particular node — a supplier facility, a distribution center, or a transportation hub — to be restored to full functionality after a disruption.</p>
<p>The second concept is risk exposure, an assessment of exposure to risk based on a model that applies suppliers' TTR to estimate the performance impact, including operational (lost production) and financial (lost revenue and profit).</p>
<h3 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business Drivers</h3>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Harvard Business Review article identified the following objectives for companies facing disaster situtations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify exposure to risk associated with parts and suppliers.</li>
<li>Prioritize and allocate resources effectively.</li>
<li>Invest in mitigation strategies such as booking logistics capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitor for disruptive environmental conditions</strong> such as severe weather, wildfires, flooding, air quality, and carbon emissions and send alerts when detected.</li>
<li><strong>Predict potential impacts</strong> of climate change and weather across the business using climate risk analytics.</li>
<li><strong>Reconfigure supply chain</strong> Some critical but vulnerable suppliers will go out of business.</li>
<li><strong>Reposition inventory</strong> in anticipation of certain regions or facilities facing disaster.</li>
<li><strong>Route deliveries around impacted areas</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>The solution shown in Figure 1 uses components that can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core application systems</strong>. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management or facilities management. These systems can be standalone applications, on-premises and cloud services, and databases.</li>
<li><strong>Foundational infrastructure</strong>. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red Hat OpenShift with data routed through API management and events routed through business automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Optimization</strong> platform consisting of a Supply Assurance Control Panel, Fulfillment Optimization, and Inventory Analysis &amp; AI.</li>

<p>Disaster preparation workflow steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>External data feed, such as IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, anticipated disruptive environmental condition
<li>Control Tower alerted to the potential disruption.
<li>Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions
<li>Inventory Analysis detects potential low stock levels and predicts extraordinary inventory demand.
<li>Colleague alerted and asked to take remediation action.
<li>Colleague triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including:
<ol type="a">
<li>Ordering more stock in nearby and affected area
<li>Adjusting stock positions within existing Supply Chain
<li>Managing inventory held at existing stores or by moving existing inventory
<li>Managing inventory held at existing warehouses or by moving existing inventory
<li>Rerouting incoming inventory around event area
</ol>
