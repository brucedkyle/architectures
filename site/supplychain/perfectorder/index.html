    <h1 id="perfect-order">Perfect order</h1>
<p>Managing inventory efficiently is critical to any business that sells physical goods, is responsible for maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) supplies. </p>
<p><em>Inventory management</em> encompasses procedures and processes that directly or indirectly affect the bottom line &dash; ordering, receiving, storing, tracking and accounting for all of the goods a business sells. It is a key element of supply chain management.</p>
<p>In this scenario, you will explore the implications of a <em>perfect and imperfect order</em> in which inventory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can meet customer expecation.</li>
<li>May not have all items available.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-problem">Business problem</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inventory visibility</strong>. Multichannel order fulfillment operations typically have inventory spread across many places throughout the supply chain. Inventory visibility is knowing what inventory you have and where it’s located. Businesses need an accurate view of inventory to guarantee fulfillment of customer orders, reduce shipment turnaround times, and minimize stockouts, oversells and markdowns.</li>
<li><strong>Orders may not match available inventory</strong>. Inventory may not be on hand or in a different location than expected. Multiple and partial shipments may be able to solve many customer requests.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-solution">Business solution</h2>
<p>The goal of <em>inventory management</em> is to have the right products in the right place at the right time. This requires inventory visibility — knowing when to order, how much to order and where to store stock. The basic steps of inventory management include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purchasing inventory</strong>. Ready-to-sell goods are purchased and delivered to the warehouse or directly to the point of sale.</li>
<li><strong>Storing inventory</strong>. Inventory is stored until needed. Goods or materials are transferred across your fulfillment network until ready for shipment.</li>
<li><strong>Profiting from inventory</strong>. The amount of product for sale is controlled. Finished goods are pulled to fulfill orders. Products are shipped to customers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>More and more businesses are looking at having sustainable supply chains because customers are demanding it. </p>

<td>Stock on hand</td>
<td><strong>Inventory visibility</strong> What goods are in stock, how much do you have and where are the items? All that information is required to fill orders.</td>
<td>An Inventory management system helps provide that information and more.</td>

<tr>
<td>Optimal inventory</td>
<td><strong>Monitor Orders &amp; Inventory</strong>  By minimizing lost sales, misplaced stock and excess ordering, inventory management boosts your profits and can even reduce your taxes.</td>
<td>Optimal inventory level is the ideal quantity of product that one should have in a fulfillment center(s) at any given time. By optimizing inventory levels, you reduce the risk of common inventory issues, from high storage costs to out-of-stock items.</td>

<h2 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business Drivers</h2>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inventory visibility</strong>. Multichannel order fulfillment operations typically have inventory spread across many places throughout the supply chain. Inventory visibility is knowing what inventory you have and where it’s located. Businesses need an accurate view of inventory to guarantee fulfillment of customer orders, reduce shipment turnaround times, and minimize stockouts, oversells and markdowns.</li>
<li><strong>Orders may not match available inventory</strong>. Inventory may not be on hand or in a different location than expected. Multiple and partial shipments may be able to solve many customer needs.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets, hand-counted stock levels and manual order placement</strong> have largely been replaced by advanced inventory tracking software. An inventory management system can simplify the process of ordering, storing and using inventory by automating end-to-end production, business management, demand forecasting and accounting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Supply chain operators will use technologies that provide significant insights into how supply chain performance can be improved. They’ll anticipate anomalies in logistics costs and performance before they occur and have insights into where automation can deliver significant scale advantages</li>
<li>Eliminate “out of stock” occurrences</li>
<li>Optimizes inventory costs by balancing inventory to operational demand</li>
<li>Improve stock allocation to improve space utilization</li>
<li>Reduce dormant/non-moving inventory</li>
<li>Have an accurate assessment of critical spares and the money invested in those parts</li>
<li>Deliver transparency and visibility to critical and non-critical spares inventory for the organization</li>
<li>Reduce time spent looking for and ordering parts</li>
<li>Accelerate disposal of obsolete materials</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-outcomes">Business outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decrease waste</strong>. Decrease order fragmentation and waste with decrease in packages per order.</li>
<li><strong>Order optimization</strong>. In-stock improvement through holiday season using Order Optimizer.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce costs</strong>. Reduced costs and emissions by housing software on the cloud more efficiently than on-premises</li>
<li><strong>Minimize disruption</strong>. Gain visibility to minimize disruption to business despite supply and demand shocks</li>
<li><strong>Returns optimization</strong>. Returns refurbished to create a revenue stream by re-circulation, refurbishment, repairs thereby reducing disposal and recycling costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>This solution focuses on <em>Automation</em> and <em>Modernization</em> in our Action Guide as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase inventory visibility</li>
<li>Monitor the criticality of inventory items to the organization </li>
<li>Accelerate automation in extended workflows</li>
<li>Amp up AI to make workflows smarter</li>
<li>Modernize for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="solution overview" src="../media/perfectordersolution.png" /></p>
<h2 id="solution-principles">Solution principles</h2>
<p><strong>True end-to-end visibility</strong>. Remove data silos and create a unified view across supply chain data with a standard data platform. Personalized dashboards and insights provide a 360-degreee view of KPIs and significant events.</p>
<p><strong>Manage by exception</strong>. Detect, display, and prioritize work tasks in real time. This allows clients to sense and react to issues quickly while managing risks and disruptions in a supply chain proactively.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligent workflows</strong>. Actionable workflows can be customized to meet unique requirements and process steps required to automate actions within source transactional systems. Make informed decisions with a supply chain virtual assistant that provides responses to issues based on a client’s supply chain data using natural language search.</p>
<h2 id="perfect-order_1">Perfect order</h2>
<p>The following diagram shows the inventory management scenario for an perfect order with responses for cases where the order is not perfect.</p>
<p><a href="../media/perfectorder-sd.svg"><img alt="prefect order schematic" src="../media/perfectorder-sd.svg" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Customer places/track/confirm order thru omni channel 
<li>Inventory fulfilment, and delivery tracking information is quicky obtained from supply assurance Platform
<li>Access underlying backend system via API Management
<li>Notify various backend systems via the Integration Services
<li>Check with the Inventory Management System if inventory is available then lock the items and update the inventory.
<li>Use Store Operations System to determine if store can fulfill order. Store can only fulfill partial order. Notify customer about partial order fill. If acceptable, package order and get it ready for delivery to customer. Go to Step 7. If partial order is not acceptable, get it ready to be sent to warehouse. Go to Step 8.
<li>Notify Transport/Logistics System to schedule delivery. 
<li>Use Warehouse Management System to find which warehouse can fulfill remaining order items. Send alert to warehouse to combine partial orders and package itmes and get it ready for delivery. Notify customer and update/sync related systems.
<li>Update Transport/Logistics System to schedule delivery.
<li>Cross check with the Fulfilment System to schedule and track the order and notify customer.
<li>Provide real-time tracking of the order to customer and upon delivery provide POD (electronic or paper) to customer.
</ol>
