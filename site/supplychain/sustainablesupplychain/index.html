    <h1 id="sustainable-supply-chain">Sustainable supply chain</h1>
<p>Businesses are looking for <strong>sustainable supply chains</strong>. Some of the questions they ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I ensure my products, vendors and partners along my supply chain are aligned with my sustainability goals?</li>
<li>Is my supply chain transparent and traceable? </li>
<li>How can I get a handle on my Scope 3 emissions?</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses are seeking to balance the long-term imperative to protect the planet with the short-term need to preserve the bottom line. </p>
<p>Examples of sustainability in business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving energy management efficiency using alternative power sources and carbon accounting</li>
<li>Deploying infrastructure that reduces GHG emissions, preserves water resources and eliminates waste </li>
<li>Operating dynamic and efficient supply chains to empower a circular economy, encourage reuse, design out waste, promote sustainable consumption and protect natural resources</li>
<li>Enabling sustainable development by assessing risks and improving resiliency while adhering to external regulations and development goals</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, we explore <strong>sustainable supply chains</strong>. Reduce waste, cost-to-serve and logistics-related emissions by optimizing fulfillment and delivery with trusted supply chain solutions that are powered by AI, backed by blockchain, and built on an open, hybrid-cloud platform.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business drivers</h2>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are several challenges to overcome in the pursuit of becoming a truly sustainable business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upfront costs to becoming a sustainable business</li>
<li>Difficuly in measuring and demonstrating lowering green house gas (GHG) emissions</li>
<li>Customers are willing to pay a premium for sustainable products</li>
<li>Creating a lower emissions business affects all business processes and departments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase creation and use of sustainable products</li>
<li>Identify and monitor energy and emissions savings opportunities to accelerate decarbonization</li>
<li>Enhance customer experience with eco-friendly packaging</li>
<li>Improve brand awareness by being known as a sustainable business</li>
<li>Delight customers with green energy delivery fleet </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>This solution focuses on <em>Automation</em> and <em>Modernization</em> in our Action Guide as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p><img alt="solution overview" src="../media/supplychainsustainabilitysolution.png" /></p>
<p>The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. </li>
<li>Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red Hat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop. </li>
<li>Inventory Optimization platform</li>
<li>Sustainability system acts as a key driver for automated product and transport selection, in addition to reporting and creating goal-driven outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sustainable-supply-chain_1">Sustainable supply chain</h2>
<p>The following diagram shows the schematic for the sustainability use case to improve your supply chain.</p>
<p><a href="../media/sustainablesupplychain-sd.svg"><img alt="sustainability schematic" src="../media/sustainablesupplychain-sd.svg" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Customer chooses items to buy online using the business app.
<li>Determine sustainability posture by determining ESG indicator values.
<li>Before providing cost and delivery options, provide customer sustainability options â€“ equivalent greener items, later delivery day, pickup option, etc. If customer opts into sustainability option order is tagged so Supply Assurance Platform can honor that request.
<li>Inventory fulfilment system updates inventory data.
<li>Delivery Optimization system plays a key role in sustainability play. It determines whether to contact 3PL or if in-house Route Optimization can fulfill the requirements.
<li>If 3PL is the only option, contact the sustainability approved 3PL company to fulfill the order. 3PL company takes over the delivery flow from here. If business has the means to fulfill the order continue with next Step 6a.
<ul>
<li>Access underlying backend system via API Management
</ul>
<li>Alert the Order Fulfilment System (OFS) this special order via system APIs.
<li>OFS notifies the Warehouse Management System to package and get it ready for delivery.
<li>The Transport/Logistics System is alerted to schedule delivery. 
<ol>
<li>Track the order, notify customer and provide real-time tracking.
<li>Delivery department maintains the sustainability posture and upon final delivery provides POD (electronic or paper) to customer.
</ol>
<li>All sub-systems are updated via the data fabric that helps maintain a consistent view.
</ol>

<h2 id="action-guide">Action Guide</h2>
<p>From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Modernization</li>
