    <h1 id="transparent-supply">Transparent supply</h1>
<p>A sustainable supply platform enables goods-specific transparency across multiple supply chain partners, enabling analytics by company, location, product movement and condition.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Track the physical flow of goods across companies for new speed to insight</li>
<li>Combine data that is typically siloed to leverage new business drivers</li>
<li>Automate transparency across companies to reach next-generation supply chain efficiency</li>
<li>Track the legacy of products, such as pharmacy and perishable items</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-problem">Business problem</h2>
<p>You can unleash the full power of data and end-to-end visibility to empower all supply chain participants and create new business value. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drive buyer engagement to grow your market.</strong> Engage and empower buyers in new ways and build trust in your brand by showing how a product was made and demonstrating support for ethical and sustainable production.</li>
<li><strong>Transform your business model to optimize revenue.</strong> Leverage supply chain visibility to improve predictions and forecasting with real-time data and optimize inventory
dynamically. Use smart contracts to automate responsiveness up and down the chain.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce supply chain complexity, errors and cost.</strong> Combine blockchain, IoT and AI to automate digitization of supply chain data, handle dispute resolution proactively and
share digital documents across companies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business Drivers</h3>
<p>Challenges</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies may be wary of sharing competitive data are more willing to participate on the platform.</li>
<li>Visibility into your supply chain is limited as goods move from the supplier’s supplier to the customer’s customer.</li>
<li>Transactions are often still paper based.</li>
</ul>
<p>Drivers</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhance traceability</strong>. If a company discovers a faulty product, the blockchain enables the firm and its supply chain partners to trace the product, identify all suppliers involved with it, identify production and shipment batches associated with it, and efficiently recall it.</li>
<li><strong>Increase efficiency and speed and reducing disruptions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Improve financing, contracting, and international transactions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce loss, increasing efficiency regarding waste management.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-outcomes">Business outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Quality assurance. Authenticate product origins and validate their provenance to demonstrate brand differentiators to consumers.</li>
<li>Improved forecasting. Improve product traceability throughout the supply chain in near real-time. Optimize with automatic replenishment.</li>
<li>Reduced friction. The use of blockchain reduces the costs of dispute resolutions, product recalls, compliance and documentation sharing.</li>
<li>Extensive automation. Shorten the timeframe to achieve automation through embedded intelligence and smart workflows.</li>
<li>Reducing loss, increasing efficiency regarding waste management.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>The solution shown in Figure 1 uses components that can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. </li>
<li>Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red Hat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.</li>
<li>Sustainable enterprise systems acts to coordinate facilities management with workplace management backed by sustainability reporting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The figures in this section show the interaction of suppliers' data to your customer systems.</p>
<h3 id="sustainable-supply">Sustainable supply</h3>
<p>In this figure, suppliers' provides data for decision making to make your supply chain more sustainable</p>

<p><em>Figure 4. Schematic diagram of the sustainable supply use case.</em></p>
<p>Sustainable supply workflow steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suppliers' software provides product sourcing updates through API
<li>API Management provides and monitors the input of the 3rd partly logistics information
<li>Your organization receives the suppliers' information and incorporates it into Sustainable Supply
<li>The Supply Assurance Control Tower surfaces the end-to-end logistics supply chain to users, such as the inventory controller and logistics
<ol type="a">
<li>Sourcing data is routed to Sustainability Control Tower for reporting
<li>Sourcing data is routed to Supply Chain Control Tower for visitibility to Inventory Controller and others and creates work queues as needed
</ol>
<li>Based on the visibility into the supply chain, the inventory controller and logistics officer can take actions to replenish supplies or to act to reduce loss
<li>The Business Automation provides a consistent way for multiple systems to respond, such as
<li>Update:
<ol type="a">
<li>Inventory management system counts of current inventory, store inventory, and future inventory
<li>Place orders in Order Management System
</ol>
</ol>

<h2 id="action-guide">Action Guide</h2>
<p>From a high-level perspective, the <strong>Action Guide</strong> represents a future state for organizations considering a comprehensive commitment. The idea is to outline a set steps that can be prioritized to reach that future state by adding new functionality to your existing systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Modernization</li>
