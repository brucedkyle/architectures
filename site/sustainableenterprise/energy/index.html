    <h1 id="energy-cost-containment">Energy cost containment</h1>
<p>Energy represents a significant cost in the business.</p>
<p>According to a paper recommended by the United States Department of Energy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most lucrative areas for improving bottom line profitability is related to an organization`s costs for utilities and energy. Such things as gas, electric, water, and telephones are treasure chests of cost reduction opportunities. In the past, these items have been viewed as a fixed expense or basic mundane commodity. In recent years, these items have become a large portion of product cost and now must be examined on a continual basis. A formal income improvement program to capture and report on the savings is a requirement for remaining competitive in a global economy. <br>&mdash; <a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/273871">Utility and energy cost containment</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pay less for energy</li>
<li>Use less energy</li>
<li>Provide data to demonstrate energy cost containment results</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Most companies are committed to actions that make your operations more sustainable. At this point, some companies have set and published specific targets.</p>
<p>Businesses are seeking to balance the long-term imperative to protect the planet with the short-term need to preserve the bottom line. </p>
<h2 id="business-problem">Business problem</h2>
<p>Businesses need a data-driven solution to demonstrate energy cost savings. Intelligent decision making of specific steps to determine costs of energy providers, capital improvement projects, energy conservation, modernization of infrastructure.</p>
<p>How do you determine the ROI on these steps to drive your sustainability goals?</p>
<h3 id="challenges-business-drivers">Challenges / Business Drivers</h3>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-05-10-IBM-Study-CEOs-Feel-Pressure-to-Act-on-Sustainability-and-See-Business-Benefits,-Yet-Hindered-by-Challenges">IBM Institute of Business Value study</a>, 48% of CEOs across industries say increasing sustainability is one of the highest priorities for their organization in the next two to three years. However, 51% also cite sustainability as among their greatest challenges in that same timeframe, with hurdles, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of data insights</li>
<li>Unclear ROI</li>
<li>Technology barriers, as hurdles. </li>
</ul>
<p>For these CEOs, scaling their business with modern infrastructure can often be one of the barriers to achieving sustainability goals.</p>
<p><strong>Business Drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Energy represents a significant cost in the business</li>
<li>Demonstrate ROI with data-driven energy cost savings</li>
<li>Investment in energy cost savings can have ROI</li>
<li>Facility maintenance responses can provide energy cost savings</li>

<p>The solution shown in Figure 1 uses components that can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. </li>
<li>Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red Hat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.</li>
<li>Sustainable enterprise systems acts to coordinate facilities management with workplace management backed by sustainability reporting.</li>

<p><em>Figure 4. Schemantic diagram for energy cost containment use case.</em></p>
<p>Energy cost containment workflow steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect sensor and energy consumption (energy, refrigerators, HVAC) across the enterprise. Unusual data can be from a piece of equipment that no longer functions, a walk-in refrigerator door being left open, HVAC that is providing temps outside of nominal ranges
<li>Sensors report to Intelligent Assets and Facilities Management software that provides alerts on abnormal behavior of data from sensors
<li>Alerts are sent to Sustainability Control Tower that takes actions to remediate consumption
<li>Business automation provides consistent ways of handling alerts, sending work orders to facility and asset management software
<li>Facility management software provides work orders, tracks the completion 
<li>Facility manager is updated on the work orders and successful completion of the remediation steps
<li>Sustainability Manager reviews KPI, update energy consumption metrics, sets energy consumption goals
</ol>
