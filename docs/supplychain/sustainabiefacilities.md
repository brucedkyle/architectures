# Sustainable facilities

## Use case

Companies are setting environmental commitments, including achieving Net Zero GHG Emissions by 2030 and diverting 90% of nonhazardous waste (by weight) from landfill and incineration by 2025. Real estate plays a critical role in meeting these targets.

Roughly 40% of the global share of annual carbon dioxide emissions comes from buildings. The UN Environment Program states that if nothing is done, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from buildings will more than double in the next 20 years.

To meet targets for green house gas (GHG) emissions, buildings and cities must shift from being part of the problem to being part of the solution. 

## Background

## Business problem

### Challenges / Business Drivers 

**Challenges**

There are several challenges to overcome in the pursuit of becoming a truly sustainable business:

- **Customer readiness**. While the mindset around sustainability is shifting, no business can afford to be left behind, and few can financially afford to be too far ahead of the appetite for sustainable offerings. Co-creating a sustainable future requires a deep understanding of your customers and having partners with the right relationships and ecosystems to bring them along on the journey.
- **Cost**. Implementing sustainable business practices typically requires higher upfront investments. In the short term, it will often be cheaper to stick with the status quo. Some organizations will need help building an investment case to show how immediate investment will result in more durable profitability over the long run.
- **Systemic inertia**. While sustainability is an important goal, it often isn’t seen as more important than other key priorities that may provide benefits sooner. Many businesses plan in ten-year increments, so while a 2050 commitment is good, it often isn’t enough to drive sufficient action in this decade, from a planning standpoint. It comes back to reframing risks as opportunities and building the case that acting on sustainability now is necessary to achieving future sustainability in business.
- **Lack of tools, insights and expertise**. Being unprepared to develop a corporate sustainability vision, strategy and framework is a monumental risk. Companies may lack the ability to implement sustainable solutions or even know where to start. Sustainability in business is evolving and so are the answers. Every business needs an ecosystem of innovation partners to help them reinvent the world and create a sustainable future.

**Drivers**

- **Sustainability is good for business**.
- **Corporate disclosure requirements** demonstrate the business environmental impact, driving businesses to curb GHG emissions.
- **Brand awareness**. 55% of consumers say environmental responsibility is very or extremely important when choosing a brand. 
- **Attractive to investors**. The rise of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment criteria and sustainable investing means that a sustainable business is inherently more attractive to the rising numbers of responsible investors. Investment in ESG assets may reach $53 trillion by 2025, representing over a third of global assets.
- **Consumers will pay premium**. In 2021, we also found that half of consumers said they were willing to pay a premium for a sustainable brand or sustainable products. And this year, 49% of consumers say they’ve paid a premium—an average of 59% more—for products branded as sustainable or socially responsible in the last 12 months.

### Responses

| Business Problem | Solution |
| - | - |
| Automating ESG Reporting | Capture and manage over  quantitative and qualitive data types to support your expanding sustainability reporting requirements to frameworks and reporting schemes  |
| Strategic goal set for sustainability | |
| Incorporate sustainability options into customer decison making | Connect your strategy with day-to-day operations to embed sustainability into your business transformation |
| Create a lower-emissions business | Build intelligent asset management into operations |

## Business outcomes

- Along with cost savings using sustainable material andcreating sustainable products helps create agreener environment
- In the long run emission ssavings results in energysavings
- Customers value eco-friendly packaging and greendelivery options which improves brand awareness
- A delivery fleet that is notdependent on fossil fuelscontributes to the business’sESG indicator values

## Solution overview

The solution shown in Figure 1 uses components that can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:

- **Core application systems**. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management or facilities management. These systems can be standalone applications, on-premises and cloud services, and databases.
- **Foundational infrastructure**. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red Hat OpenShift with data routed through API management and events routed through business automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.
- **Inventory Optimization** platform consisting of a Supply Assurance Control Panel, Fulfillment Optimization, and Inventory Analysis & AI.

## Action Guide

From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain:

- Automation
- Sustainability
- Modernization

| | Actionable Step | Implementation details |
| - | - | - |
| Automation | Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation | Integrate data from multiple systems to get enterprise-wide view of changes in inventory demand. Monitor and analyze near real-time data |
| Automation | Accelerate automation in extended workflows | As an example, in the Reduce out of stock (OOS) or approaching out of stock (AOOS) conditions, a SCIS Control Tower monitors inventory levels at all locations in a client's network and creates items in the work queue when revenue is at risk. |
| Automation | Amp up AI to make workflows smarter | When users are inspecting inventory items by drilling down on the item, users see where they have available inventory and receive recommendations about how much inventory can and should be transferred to the OOS / AOOS locations. These recommendations are based on adding automation and AI to make workflows smarter. |
| Sustainability | Include sustainability commitments in decision making | Integrate sustainability metrics in overstock and understock decision making. |
| Modernization | Modernization for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms | The decision for a future, Kubernetes-based enterprise platform is defining the standards for development, deployment and operations tools and processes for years to come and thus represents a foundational decision point. |

For specific steps on this approach, see **The Action Guide** details in [_Own Your Transformation_](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/1BYY6VEM) survey of 1500 CSCOs across 24 industries.
