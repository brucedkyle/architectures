# Loss and waste management

A key focus when dealing with loss and waste management in relation to inventory optimization is how to handle unplanned or unforseen situations causing an inventory item be considered damaged or spoiled. If the situation or problem is rectified withing a well defined time window, there is a possibility of salvaging the product. In some cases once the incident occurs, there is no possibility of salvage and the product is considered damaged. Typically these events are external factors forced upon the business and cannot always be planned or predicted. 

To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimization for any business, we will focus on two main use cases of an unanticipated exception:

- **Environment Exceptions** such as power outages or temperature changes that creates potential spoilage 
- **Product contamination or recall** such as foreign objects or bacteria occuring earlier in the processing or supply chain

We will start by defining the business problem and the two main use cases: Environmental Exceptions and Product contamination or recall, describe the challenges and business drivers organizations face. Next, we will provide an action guide, provide an overview of the solution, show a schematic of the two use cases: Environmental Exceptions and Product contamination or recall, and conclude with the technology used in the solution.

For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see [Inventory Optimization](supplychain.md).


## Business problem

Loss and waste management is principally focused on ensuring food and food related products remain fit for consumption at the time they are sold to the end consumer. However, external factors outside the control of the business can cause food items to be marked as spoiled or damaged. The problem faced by the business is ensuring the overall loss and wastage is minimised.

To prevent spoilage, food products must typically be stored and transported at temperatures within well defined ranges. For example:
- Frozen food must be kept below a specific temperature (0°F) at all times. If the temperature rises and food defrosts, it cannot be refrozen.
- Chilled food must be kept within a temperature range (34°F - 39°F). The temperature can sometimes go above the higher limit for a short space of time before returning to the correct temperature, without becoming spoiled. If the high temperature is exceeded for a specified duration it must be considered spoiled.
- Shelf stable food does not require chilling, but needs to be stored withing a temperature range to ensure the product shelf life is maintained. A shelf stable food product's shelf life can be 6 weeks to 5 years, depending on the product.

To keep food at the correct temperature, refrigeration and chilling during transport and storage are the primary options. Power outages will happen. The ability to deal with the situation within well defined time periods is critical to ensuring the loss and wastage is minimised. If the problem can be rectified quickly and easily, there is every chance the product can remain in perfect conditiona and be sold to a consumer. Failure to act quickly will result in spoilage and loss of the product.

Between farm and end consumer, food products generally go through multiple stages which vary depending on the end product. For convenience foods, there can be several manufuacturing steps, for fresh produce packaging and transport are the main stages. At any stage in the process, there is a possibility of contamination through foreign objects or bacteria. Both of which can trigger a recall of the food products. With any kind of contamination, a fast and efficient recall process to prevent the products beng purchased by consumers is vital.

All retailers handing and selling food products need processes to reduce food waste through external factors and ensure recall procedures in the event of contamination are fast, efficient and minimise any risk to public health.


## Use cases
The main use cases represented by loss management are:

- **Environmental Exceptions** &dash; an environmental issue or problem places the food product at risk. If the issue is not dealt with quickly and efficiently the product will be spoiled making unavailable for sale to a consumer. Typically this would be a failure of refrigeration equipment or a loss of power to refrigeration euipment. If the temperature can be kept within a specific range, the product will remain suitable for sale to a consumer. If the temperature moves beyond the specified range for a set period of time, the product will be considered spoiled and no longer suitable for sale to a consumer.
- **Product contamination or recall** &dash; a contamination or recall requires the food product to be removed immediately from the inventory and supply chain. The contamination issue or recall notice can come from external parties such as suppliers or food standards agencies, or through the retailer identifying an issue. Once the issue has been identified, the reatiler must immediately remove all affected products from their own inventory and supply chain, then destroy or pass the product to a third party. The issue can be caused by foreign objects or the detection of selected bateria in the product.


## Challenges / Business Drivers 

**Challenges**

- Protect public health: Businesses that sell consumable products are expected to protect the public health by implementing specific processes to address food safety. Maintaining equipment that refrigerates or freezes food or pharmaceutical products for storage until purchase or combined into a recipe and responding to and documenting actions taken to a food safety recall notification by either the supplier or regulatory body are key challenges.
- Regulatory compliance: Business that sell consumable products are expected to comply with local, state, and federal regulatory requirements for food and pharmaceutical products. Automated documentation of compliance is preferred over manual, error-prone documentation.

**Drivers**

- Industry leading inventory management system, incorporating sensors that can mitigate risks before they create an exposure.
- Integrating loss and waste management into the core supply chain applications, leveraging technical investments in modern infrastructures and edge devices.
- Protect Reputation
- Avoid Penalties and fines


### Responses

- Risks mitigated

## Solution overview 

This solution focuses on _Automation_ and _Modernization_ in our Action Guide as shown in the following diagram:

- Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation. 
- Accelerate automation in extended workflows
- Amp up AI to make workflows smarter
- Modernize for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms

![solution overview](./media/lossmanagementsolution.png)

The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into three main categories as shown in the following diagram:

- Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such as order management, facilities management. These systems can be stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases. 
- Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on RedHat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop. 
- Inventory Optimization platform


## Solution principles

**True end-to-end visibility**. Remove data silos and create a unified view across supply chain data with a standard data platform. Personalized dashboards and insights provide a 360-degreee view of KPIs and significant events.

**Manage by exception**. Detect, display, and prioritize work tasks in real time. This allows clients to sense and react to issues quickly while managing risks and disruptions in a supply chain proactively.

**Intelligent workflows**. Actionable workflows can be customized to meet unique requirements and process steps required to automate actions within source transactional systems. Make informed decisions with a supply chain virtual assistant that provides responses to issues based on a client’s supply chain data using natural language search.
