# Inventory management

Managing inventory efficiently is critical to any business that sells physical goods. Inventory management encompasses procedures and processes that directly or indirectly affect the bottom line - ordering, receiving, storing, tracking and accounting for all of the goods a business sells. It is a key element of supply chain management.
